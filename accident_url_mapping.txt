Suspected members of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) were responsible for the \"reprehensible act\" which took place early Wednesday, residents and military sources said. Local media reported that the militants had come to the locality to levy taxes on fishing activity but met with resistance from the fishermen. While expressing shock and sadness over the killings, a military official in the region who asked for anonymity told Xinhua that the army would deploy more personnel to secure the lake. The ISWAP has collaborated with the Boko Haram group with the aim of establishing an Islamist state in northeastern Nigeria. The two groups have also extended the reach of their attacks to other countries in the Lake Chad Basin.

With the finding of the bodies of fishermen, locals accused that these two persons had died due to an assault by Indian fishermen who had encroached on Sri Lankan waters.\nPolice said the two victims had been identified as 37-year-old Joseph Premkumar, a resident of the Wattirayan area, and his sister’s son T.K. Arunkumar (21). Both had gone missing at sea while fishing.\nIt is reported that the two persons had gone fishing on January 27 and the relatives had complained to Police that there was no information about their whereabouts.\nNavy spokesman Captain Indika de Silva said the Navy and fishermen in the area launched a search operation for the missing persons.\nHe added that the Navy conducts continuous search operations and conducts patrol services regularly to mitigate Indian encroaching.\nFollowing these continuous operations two Indian fishing boats along with 21 fishermen who had crossed   the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) into Sri Lankan waters were taken into custody by the Navy on Monday night.\nThe Northern Naval Commander had a discussion with the representatives of fishing societies of the area yesterday aiming at reaching an acceptable solution for the fisheries community.\nHowever residents of the area highlighted that there should be a diplomatic mediation to seek a long-lasting solution to the longstanding Indo-Lanka fisheries issue.\nResidents of the Marudankeni area yesterday blocked the gates of the Marudankeni Divisional Secretariat and staged a protest demanding justice for the deaths of the missing fishermen and a solution to the Indian fisheries problem.\nThe protestors said that Jaffna fishermen were unable to carry on their business due to the encroachment on Sri Lankan waters and that the fishing industry in the North was facing a serious crisis due to the incessant plundering by Indian fishermen.\nThe Navy also detained several bottom trawling equipment and fish caught by this illegal fishing method from the seized fishing trawlers.\nThe operation was conducted adhering to COVID-19 protocols due to pandemic concerns. Meanwhile, necessary arrangements are being made to produce the apprehended Indian fishermen before the relevant authorities, after directing them for Rapid Antigen Tests for COVID-19.\nThe Sri Lanka Navy will continue to carry out regular operations in Sri Lankan territorial waters to prevent illegal fishing practices and other forms illegal acts, with a view to protect the fishery resources of the country and ensure the livelihood of local fishermen, the Navy spokesman said.\nAn Indian High Commission official when contacted by the Daily News said that the Indian Consulate in Jaffna has been providing consular assistance to the fishermen arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy. Asked about the alleged attack by the Indian fishermen on their Sri Lankan counterparts, he said that both sides have been levelling allegations at each other.\nThe Point Pedro Magistrate’s Court last week released 56 Indian fishermen who were arrested for poaching in Sri Lankan waters on conditional bail. Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda is scheduled to meet Fisheries Federation representatives of Saturday and discuss illegal poaching by Indian fishermen who cross the IMBL.\n“The Minister will address a press conference to make the public aware of the issue and the steps taken by the Government to solve this issue,” a Ministry official said yesterday.\nThe authorities are also planning to auction several boats seized from Indian fishermen poaching in Northern waters over the last few years.\nTags: Print Edition\nAdd new comment\nYour name\nSubject\nComment *\nLeave this field blank\nRelated Articles\n<div class=\"views-lazy-load\">Loading...</div>\nLatest News\nSergeant, WPC interdicted for misplacing complaint book\nThe Nuwara Eliya Assistant Superintendent of Police has interdicted a...\nLotteries to be Rs.40 from today\nThe price of lotteries sold by the Development Lottery Board and the...\nThree floating bodies found\nThree unidentified bodies floating in the coastal sea area in Dehiwala and...\nFake shooting: Director, three remanded till July 19\nColombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya yesterday (5) ordered...\nJaffna bus set on fire by owner to cash in on Rs. 30 Mn insurance\nInformation has been revealed that a luxury bus that was running from...\nPolice IDs of SP, OIC go missing in Kataragama\nPolice IDs of two Senior Police officials who were on special official...\nAnticipatory bail refused for former Kandy Girls’ School Principal\nThe anticipatory bail application filed by the lawyers of the former...\nWanted suspect arrested after knife attack on police in Pettah\nA person who tried to attack the police officers with a knife has been...\nEditor's Pick\nNew laws to prohibit actions that threaten religious harmony - Minister\nStock market endorses DDO\nLitro gas prices below Rs. 3,000 from midnight today\nSri Lanka will be able to shed its bankruptcy status by September - President\nPUCSL approves overall 14.2% electricity tariff reduction\nEntire banking system relieved of burden\nCabinet unanimously approves DDR\nDebt restructuring will not affect superannuation funds - President\nRecent comments\nWIND POWER AND SOLAR\n2 years 12 months ago\nFor once.

(SBC YouTube)Photo license  Purchase photo\nSend to Kindle\n(Seychelles News Agency) - Two Spanish nationals died in Seychelles when their fishing vessel had an ammonia leak while on anchorage close to Port Victoria and local rescue services are still working to contain the leak, a top official said on Thursday.\nJones Madeleine, the public relations officer of the Seychelles Fire and Rescue Services Agency, told reporters that they were informed about the leak on the Spanish-flagged tuna fishing vessel Albacora Cuatro around 3.15 pm on Wednesday afternoon. Today they are still working to contain the leak on the vessel, which was anchored for repair work.\n\"The work we carried out yesterday was to get the two people who were trapped on the vessel. We sent another team this morning to the vessel to continue the work we started,\" said Madeleine.\nThe vessel, which is 88 metres long and 16 metres wide belongs to the Compañía Europea de Tunidos company, although the ship retains the name of the Albacora group, founded in 1974 by Basque businessmen.\nThe vessel had a crew of 31 people of six different nationalities on board as well as one Seychellois.\nMadeleine said that the delay in the rescue services is due to the fact that the vessel is unsafe for both the vessel's crew and the rescue services team.\n\"We were unable to rescue one of the persons trapped on the vessel and we are working to do that today. The person was unable to get off the vessel after the leak and has died but we still have to retrieve his remains,\" added Madeleine.\nMadeleine (2nd right) said they were informed about the leak on the Albacora Cuatro around 3.15 pm on Wednesday afternoon. (Rita Joubert-Lawen, Seychelles News Agency) Photo License: CC-BY\nA paramedic and another medical officer are also working alongside the rescue team in an effort to retrieve the body of the trapped sailor.\nAmmonia is a refrigerant used to freeze the brine solution within the fish wells onboard tuna vessels. It is a toxic gas and exposure to it can cause serious and sometimes fatal injuries, including ammonia burns on the eyes and lungs, asthma, blindness, and other pulmonary conditions. It is also flammable and can cause explosions when exposed to high heat.\nThe authorities confirmed that the vessel's current mooring location means that the leak is not dangerous for nearby residents on the main island of Mahe.\nA team of 16 fire and rescue officers is still on the vessel, working to contain the leak.\nWhen the incident was reported on Wednesday afternoon, the police closed off the roads to the Victoria Petrol Station and the Ile du Port quay to clear the area, so rescue and medical assistance officers could get through.\nThe rescue team working to contain the leak on Albacora Cuatro also called on the public to stay clear of the tuna fishing vessel for their own safety.\nAs the vessel may currently be a danger to others sailing going close by it, the Seychelles Coast Guard and the Seychelles Maritime Safety Authority have been deployed to keep the passing vessels at a safe distance.\nThe last such ammonia leak in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the western Indian Ocean, was on French purse seiner Le Titan Concarneau in May 2017.

After they spent time fishing, the third colleague left them to attend to some other duties elsewhere.\nUpon his return, he could not find the duo. He alerted other community members, resulting in a search party.\nLater the police sub aqua unit joined forces with the community in the search, leading to the recovery of the bodies.\nMashonaland West acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ian Kohwera on Monday said: “The sad incident occurred at Ndomo Fishing Camp on 27 March 2023. Honest Muzingili aged 21 and Tapiwa Malowa aged 26, both from Ndomo Fishing Camp were fishing together with Edward Munsaka, aged 51. Munsaka left the site and proceeded home leaving two fishermen, but they never followed him back and he became suspicious.”\nKohwera said on March 31, 2023, Munsaka and the community mobilised themselves to try to locate the pair, but the search was in vain.\n“A missing persons’ report was made at Kariba Police Station and the sub-aqua unit attended the report. On April 1, the two bodies were retrieved and taken to Kariba Hospital mortuary for post-mortem.”Keep Reading ‘Binga not fully marketed’ Increased poaching in Kariba threatens fish farming Kariba fishing tourney breaks with tradition Feature: Villagers brace for another displacement.

Among the missing are 18 foreign nationals, including 11 Americans.Hurricane Otis is the strongest hurricane on record to hit Mexico's Pacific Coast, making landfall with winds up to 165 mph. Prior to Otis, the strongest hurricane on record to hit Mexico's Pacific Coast was Category 4 Hurricane Patricia in 2015.So far, 46 people have been confirmed dead. But some officials have been skeptical about the government's death toll.A woman walks on a debris-strewn street in a tourist area, in the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, in Acapulco, Mexico, Nov. 1, 2023.Jose Luis Gonzalez/ReutersPicture of the damages caused by Hurricane Otis at the Los Flamingos hotel, where the so-called Tarzan House -former residence of actor Johny Weissmuller, famous for representing 'Tarzan' in numerous films- is located, in Acapulco, state of Guerrero, Mexico, on Oct. 31, 2023.Francisco Robles/AFP via Getty ImagesMORE: 27 dead after Hurricane Otis makes landfall in Mexico as Category 5 stormAlejandro Martínez Sidney, president of the local chamber of commerce in Acapulco, said in an interview with a local outlet that they've counted about 120 dead or missing at sea alone, some of whose bodies have washed up on the beach.People in the famous party town were so unprepared, an untold number of fishermen and boat crews were still out at sea. They are now among those missing.A week after the storm hit, many are still without bottled water, food, electricity and internet and about 63,000 businesses have totally collapsed, according to Martínez Sidney.View of damages caused by the passage of Hurricane Otis in Acapulco, Guerrero State, Mexico, taken on Oct. 31, 2023.Salvador Valadez/AFP via Getty ImagesAn aerial view of a damaged building, in the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, in Acapulco, Mexico, Nov. 1, 2023.Jose Luis Gonzalez/ReutersMORE: Climate change making Atlantic hurricanes twice as likely to strengthen from weak to major intensity in 24 hoursThe families of the missing say at least those bodies are being recovered, as the Mexican navy retrieves vessels in Acapulco's bay and at times the bodies trapped in them.On Thursday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced a $4.3 billion reconstruction plan, including 250,000 packages of household appliances and food for local families and $2,000 to $3000 per damaged home -- with an estimated 220,000 damaged in total, according to The Associated Press.People wait in line to fill water jugs, in the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, in Acapulco, Mexico, Nov. 1, 2023.Jose Luis Gonzalez/ReutersBut López Obrador has spent much time in the last week fighting with his perceived political enemies, accusing them of exaggerating the damage from Otis to hurt him politically -- even as he has actively tried to minimize it.\"It wasn't that bad for us because when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, there were 2,000 deaths,\" López Obrador said Monday.Related TopicsHurricanesMexicoPopular ReadsWhite House budget office suspends federal financial aid programsJan 28, 12:06 AMAmid Trump's tariff threats, Colombia sends plane to pick up 110 deported citizensJan 27, 8:58 PMTrump says NJ drones 'authorized' after suggesting Biden kept public 'in suspense'Jan 28, 1:29 PMKansas faces one of the largest tuberculosis outbreaks in US historyJan 28, 4:05 PMWithout putting hand on Bible, Trump takes oath of officeJan 20, 5:21 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2025 ABC News",

(From Yakutat Fire/EMS)\nOne person died and three others survived after a skiff overturned near Yakutat on Sunday. The search for the skiff began shortly after the Yakutat Fire Department got a call reporting a group of overdue boaters who had left earlier in the day on a fishing trip.  Yakutat Police Sgt. Jesse Picard said in an interview that the boaters departed from a local lodge around 7 a.m. Sunday to go fishing near Khantaak Island. Around 9 a.m., their boat was hit by a rogue wave and overturned. They were able to climb on top of the boat but another wave flipped them back into the water. Three of the passengers swam to shore.  Picard says one of the survivors walked to the southeast side of the island where he could see Yakutat and began swimming toward town. He was later rescued from the water by good Samaritans. Crew from a nearby Allen Marine boat spotted the other two survivors on land, and were able to direct a search party to their location.  Picard says one of the survivors was medevaced to Anchorage to treat non-life-threatening injuries. The other two were quickly discharged from the Yakutat Clinic.

(Courtesy Jeff Rowe)\nFishermen in Bristol Bay are mourning one of their own who died Friday during the sockeye salmon gillnet fishery. Alaska State Troopers said in  an online dispatch that Corwin Wheeler, 21, became tangled in gear and fell overboard.Wheeler was working as a deckhand on the gillnetter Anny Joy in Kvichak Bay when he went overboard. Another deckhand, Jackson Wilder, said Wheeler was throwing a hook to pull their net in when he got wrapped in the line.Wilder said that the crew on deck tried to free Wheeler but he fell overboard. Wilder said it’s possible Wheeler was already unconscious when he fell.Wilder said he jumped into the water wearing his full rain gear and boots and swam 20 feet to Wheeler. He tried to keep Wheeler’s head above water but he had to let go because he was tiring quickly. Neither Wilder nor Wheeler were wearing PFDs at the time, which is not uncommon when commercial fishing.The crew pulled Wilder in with a line, then threw buoys and floats overboard so that if Wheeler regained consciousness he would have something to grab. They finally got Wheeler back on board when they pulled up the net. Wilder and the boat’s captain performed CPR until state troopers arrived to take over.Wilder calls the death a freak accident and said there was no wrongdoing by anyone. He said that it was a normal day and that the crew was well rested.Wheeler’s father, Jeff Rowe, spoke with KDLG. He said Wheeler was a wonderful kid and that he was becoming an incredible man.“I just wish I had more time,” Rowe said.Wheeler’s mother, Leah Wheeler-Riggazi, said her son will be greatly missed by his sister Zoe and all of his family, as well as by the friends and family that he created while fishing in Alaska and back home in Wisconsin.He grew up in Trevor, Wisconsin, and then went to high school in Round Lake, Illinois. Wheeler had fished in Alaska for a number of years with Alaska Leader Fisheries, a hook and line company. According to his grandmother, Denise Rowe, this was his first year commercial fishing for sockeye salmon.Rowe said that Wheeler first started fishing in Alaska when some friends went up.“And Corwin stayed out there. And he got into that. And he loved it,” Rowe said. “He made a lot of friends. They, you know, they had really good times. And he was happy.”The family described Wheeler as intelligent, outgoing and a committed friend.“He was just so smart. And he had a quick wit and he made friends easy. It was like you knew him forever,” Rowe said.Rowe said she hopes other crews out on the water will do what they can to stay safe this season. She hopes “for these young guys, and family guys, to be careful. And watch out for one another.”According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, around one in 10 commercial fishing deaths involve gear entanglement. This was the first commercial fishing death on the water in Bristol Bay since 2021.Correction:  An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the vessel, the F/V Anny Joy.\nLatest News\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nMeg Duff, KDLG - Dillingham\nSee stories by Meg Duff, KDLG - Dillingham\nStay Connected\ntwitter\ninstagram\nyoutube\nfacebook\nAlaska Public Media © 2025.

The report said the crew includes 17 from China, 17 from Indonesia and five from the Philippines. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang have ordered Chinese diplomats abroad, as well as the agriculture and transportation ministries, to assist in the search for survivors. “All-out efforts” must be made in the rescue operation, Xi was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency. Li ordered unspecified measures to “reduce casualties and strengthen safety management of fishing vessels at sea to ensure safe maritime transport and production,” Xinhua said. No word was given on the cause of the capsizing.\nAustralia, Indonesia and the Philippines have also expressed their willingness to join in the search. Indonesia’s National Search and Rescue Agency said the capsizing occurred about 4,600 kilometers (2,900 miles) northwest of Australia.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nNearly 250 million children missed school last year because of extreme weather, UNICEF says\nIndia’s navy launches submarine, warships to guard against China’s presence in Indian Ocean\nComoros holds a parliamentary election boycotted by some opposition parties\nSeveral ships and an Australian Defense Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft have been searching the area. The Indian Ocean stretches from South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula to east Africa and western Australia. No survivors or life rafts have been spotted. The Philippine Coast Guard Command Center said Wednesday it was monitoring the situation and coordinating with the Chinese Embassy in Manila, as well as search and rescue teams operating near the vessel’s last known location.\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it was coordinating the search in what it called a remote location in the Indian Ocean, about 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) northwest of the coastal city of Perth. It said the agency received a distress beacon signal from the fishing vessel at about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, Australian time, and that weather conditions in the area Tuesday were “extreme,” but had improved by Wednesday.\nAlong the Bay of Bengal at the Indian Ocean’s northern end, Myanmar and Bangladesh were undergoing recovery from a powerful cyclone that smashed into their coastlines, causing widespread destruction and at least 21 deaths, with hundreds of others believed missing.Merchant and fishing vessels in the area were also searching for survivors Wednesday.A Perth-based Challenger rescue aircraft will drop a buoy to help with drift modelling to further assist in the search, the agency said. The search covered an area virtually in the center of the Indian Ocean. The capsized hull was spotted and the transmitter detected more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Sri Lanka, with nearest port appearing to be the island chain of the Maldives, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the north of the search area. The Lu Peng Yuan Yu 028 was based in the eastern coastal province of Shandong, operated by the Penglai Jinglu Fishery Co. Ltd., according to the reports. Another Chinese vessel, Lu Peng Yuan Yu 018, is operating near to the upturned hull and has been asked to conduct a grid search for survivors, according to the Indonesian agency.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said additional rescue assets were on their way to the scene. “We will continue to take all measures possible with all parties to search and rescue the missing persons. The Chinese side thanks the Australian maritime search and rescue department for promptly dispatching aircraft and coordinating passing foreign ships to participate in the search and rescue,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing Wednesday.China is believed to operate the world’s largest fishing fleet. Many of them stay at sea for months or even years at a time, supported by Chinese state maritime security agencies and a sprawling network of support vessels.Chinese squid fishing ships have been documented using wide nets to illegally catch already overfished tuna as part of a surge in unregulated activity in the Indian Ocean, according to a report released in 2021 by a Norway-based watchdog group that highlighted growing concerns about the lack of international cooperation to protect marine species on the high seas.\nThe group, called Trygg Mat Tracking, found that the number of squid vessels in the high seas of the Indian Ocean — where fishing of the species is not regulated — has increased six-fold since 2016.The U.S. Coast Guard was also involved in a dangerous confrontation with Chinese vessels not far from Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands in 2022 during a mission to inspect the vessels for any signs of illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. Chinese fishing vessels operating illegally are known to sail “dark,” with their mandatory tracking device that gives a ship’s position either switched off, transmitting intermittently, or providing false identifiers. In 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was believed to have gone down somewhere in the Indian Ocean with 239 people aboard. That Boeing 777, which remains missing, became invisible to civilian radar when its transponder locating device stopped transmitting during a flight from Kuala Lumpur.\n___Associated Press writers Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.\nMost read\nFederal judge temporarily blocks Trump administration freeze on federal grants and loans\nTrump offering federal workers buyouts with about 8 months’ pay in effort to shrink government\nHighlights from Trump’s 9th day in office\nKaroline Leavitt, the youngest White House press secretary, makes her debut in the briefing room\nCaroline Kennedy warns senators that cousin RFK Jr. is a ‘predator’\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

China claims all of Taiwan as part of its territory.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office strongly condemned the deaths and called for an investigation, saying “such a malicious event during the Spring Festival seriously hurts the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” Both China and Taiwan are celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday.The statement accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan of using “all sorts of excuses to forcefully inspect Chinese fishing vessels, and using violent and dangerous methods towards Chinese fishermen.”\nThe unnamed Chinese vessel had been sailing about one nautical mile off the coast of an islet of Kinmen island, Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration said in a statement.

From some parts of the archipelago, the southern Chinese city of Xiamen is visible to the naked eye.Kinmen residents in recent years have reported seeing an increase in sand dredger vessels from China, which take sand from the ocean floor, as well as fishing ships, close to its coast.

The body was discovered by an unknown man who called the police and informed them about the incident.\nAs per the reports, the police team led by a sergeant arrived at the scene and assessed the entire situation. They also sealed the area and started an investigation into the matter. Upon arriving at the scene, they discovered the body of a male of East Indian ethnicity lying on the ground face down in mud alongside the foreshore.\nPolice further explained the situation and added that the situation has also been assessed by the Coast Guard people, who said that they discovered the body on Wednesday, so it might have reached the shore on this day only.\nThe body was clad in a red t-shirt and short pants and further taken to start the investigation for more clarification. The police also took photos of the body and recorded the entire scene during proper examination of the body. However, the police did not discover any mark of violence on the body due to the advanced state of decomposition.\nAs per the police officials, the body could have been decomposed in the water at the sea for a longer time which could have removed the potential marks on the body. The body was further taken to Bailey’s Funeral Parlour, where the police have been waiting for identification and autopsy.\nAfter some days, a woman named Hardai Samlall identified the body and stated that he could be her brother named Ramdeo Samlall. At approximately 15:10 hrs, Hardai Samlall, a 74-year-old pensioner residing at Lot 14 Harbon Spoon Dam, Cotton Tree Village, West Coast Berbice, accompanied the police to Bailey’s Funeral Home at No. 4 Village, WCB.\nShe identified the body to be that of brother Ramdeo Samlall, called ‘Monk’, a 49-year-old fisherman living at the said address who had gone missing at sea since April 12, 202.\nAccording to information received, Samlall and Barat Bissoondial, both of the same address, left home last Friday for a fishing trip and expected to return home the following day.\nAfter the men had not returned home, family members became worried, and a missing person was filed at the Blairmont Police Station.

They then threw them into the sea.  The incident occurred aboard the ‘FB Bhai Bhai,’ a fishing trawler that sailed 90 km from the Patharghata Fishing Port at around 1:30 am on Saturday, said Golam Mostafa, president of Barguna Fishermen Trawler Owners Association.The robbers held another nine fishermen in the trawler hostage and looted their cargo, he said.All fishermen in the trawler were natives of Noli village in Barguna.“While leaving the trawler, the robbers ruined the engine. The trawler drifted, but eventually came within mobile network range and the fishermen were able to contact the trawler owners’ association at around 4:30 pm on Saturday,” said Golam Mostafa.A trawler was sent to rescue the fishermen and their vessel, he said.The group had set off around 10 pm from Mahipur on Friday on the ‘FB Bhai Bhai’ to fish, said Nur Mohammad, an assistant driver of the trawler. At around 2 am, as they reached the deep sea area, another trawler rammed into them.“A group of 8 to 10 robbers got on board the trawler and began to stab and shoot us. Khokon, a fisherman, fell into the sea after being shot.”The robbers stabbed trawler driver Shafiq, Qayum Joarder, Yasin Joarder, Abul Kalam, Khairul, Abdul Hai, Abdul Alim and Farid Mia and threw them into the sea, Nur said.They took another nine fishermen hostage in the trawler and looted their fishing nets, ropes, and other goods worth Tk 1.5 million.Police were informed about the robbery, said Barguna Police Superintendent Md Abdus Salam.The authorities arranged for the rescue of the fishermen, he said.\nRelated Stories\nStudents from 7 colleges call off programmes\nBorder meeting: Bangladesh to change its ‘tone’ with India\nGovernor blames clients for funds stuck in weak banks\nRailway schedule disrupted after strike\nRead More\nEC meet to review key laws, policies\nFire breaks out outside Man City stadium\nBangla Academy revises award list\nLeverkusen sign Buendia from Villa\nRead More\nOpinion\nTanvir A Mishuk\nDeepSeek’s AI revolution disrupts the market\nSyed Badrul Ahsan\nThe history of the 1969 Mass Upsurge\nMd.

The trawler was found in the Nazirartek Point area near the estuary of the Bankkhali River around 3pm on Sunday, said Mohammad Mahfuzul Islam, superintendent of district police. Some locals believe they were killed due to a dispute between fishermen as families started identifying them as people from professions other than fishing. They could not be identified immediately as they had decomposed to a level where their facial features were mostly unrecognisable, Superintendent Mahfuzul said. Asked about the suspicion of the locals, he said police had news that some people had left home 10-12 days ago but did not return. They had told their families that they would go to the sea or showed some other reasons to leave home.“We’re getting all kinds of information. We can confirm everything once the investigation ends,” he said in the evening. He earlier said they believed the bodies were of Bangladeshi citizens. “We’ve sent those to Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital for autopsy. We may know the motive behind the murders if we can identify them.”The Criminal Investigation Department and the Police Bureau of Investigation were also working on the case. Rubel Mia, a local, said fishermen in another trawler towed the ill-fated vessel near the coast after spotting it half-sunken on Saturday afternoon. They thought the trawler had capsized in a storm two days ago. Locals called the police after seeing a leg in the trawler at night, but the vessel drifted away.Police returned to the coast on Sunday morning and waited for low tide. They also called the Fire Service and Civil Defence.Khalilur Rahman, a senior officer at Cox’s Bazar Fire Station, said they used a dinghy to inspect the trawler and found the bodies locked inside a cold storage “It appears from the decomposition and foul odour that the victims died 10 to 15 days ago. Signs of wounds cannot be confirmed, but it seems they were killed.” Josna Begum from Chakaria identified one of the bodies as Md Tareque Mia, 20, a mason who left home on Apr 7. Josna later learned that two other youths of the area, Saifullah and Shahjahan, were also missing.Saiful Islam, 23, a farm labour, was identified among the dead by his father Shahab Mia from Moheshkhali. Shahab said Saiful also left home on Apr 7 and did not return.The father got information on Apr 9 that Saiful and some other people had gone fishing in the sea. People who gathered outside the hospital’s mortuary said families identified some other victims but decided not to claim the bodies. Aktar Kamal, councillor of the local ward, said: “Many have claimed that it was related to an incident of piracy in the sea 15 days ago. We can’t confirm anything. No one has claimed ownership of the boat.”\nRelated Stories\nStudents from 7 colleges call off programmes\nBorder meeting: Bangladesh to change its ‘tone’ with India\nGovernor blames clients for funds stuck in weak banks\nRailway schedule disrupted after strike\nRead More\nEC meet to review key laws, policies\nFire breaks out outside Man City stadium\nBangla Academy revises award list\nLeverkusen sign Buendia from Villa\nRead More\nOpinion\nTanvir A Mishuk\nDeepSeek’s AI revolution disrupts the market\nSyed Badrul Ahsan\nThe history of the 1969 Mass Upsurge\nMd.

One of the crew members reportedly jumped into the water in an attempt to recover the casualty, but unfortunately the casualty disappeared under water.”\n“The search had continued for a while through to Thursday morning but later, the casualty vessel and those assisting with the search reported that they were released from the search for the person in the water.\n“With all information at its hands, MRCC Cape Town having considered the matter, decided to stand down. That notwithstanding, a ‘PAN PAN’ broadcast was made to all vessels in the vicinity until 11h00 to be on the lookout for a lifejacket sighting and report such to the MRCC when made,” said SAMSA.\nSAMSA further confirmed that the incident remains under investigation.\n(SAMSA file photo)\nMeanwhile, in Cape Town on Friday, SAMSA confirmed  yet another shipping incident at the port of Cape Town wherein two ships collided, but without causing injuries to people.\nSAMSA said in Pretoria on Friday: “The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) can confirm an incident involving the Ambience Cruise Ship and the Grey Fox Cargo Ship at the Cape Town Harbour earlier today. The incident occurred during berthing operations when the Ambience made contact with another vessel and the quay.\n“We are relieved to confirm that there have been no injuries because of this incident. Furthermore, there is no risk to the environment, nor to the safety of the vessel or the port. The Ambience sustained minor damages.\n“The Port Authority is actively managing the situation, and a SAMSA surveyor is currently on-site conducting a thorough assessment to understand the circumstances surrounding the incident and to evaluate the extent of the damage.”\nEnd.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\nPosted on April 5, 2024April 5, 2024 by South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)Posted in Breaking News, Maritime Education, Research & Development, sea rescue, shipping, Training & Skills DevelopmentTagged Atlantic Ocean, FV Hesko, Lamberts Bay, Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centr, MRCC, port of Cape Town, SAMSA, search and rescue, ship collision, South African Maritime Authority, Telkom Maritime Radio Services.\nPost navigation\nPrevious Previous post: Group of people lost at sea for two days off Cape Point, found: SAMSANext Next post: South Africa’s Department of Employment & Labour joins forces with SAMSA and others to bolster sound working conditions for the country’s commercial fishing sector workers – with forced labour an immediate target.\n2 thoughts on “Search for fishing vessel crewman gone overboard off Lamberts Bay called off: SAMSA”\nVerane Fransman says:\nApril 10, 2024 at 9:24 pm\nIs the search still on for the missing crewmen the gone overboard?\nLoading...\nReply\nSouth African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) says:\nApril 15, 2024 at 3:03 pm\nHello Verane.

Fortunately, during that incident, all 22 crew members were rescued on time.\nRegarding the latest incident involving the Namibian fisherman, the MRCC said on Tuesday that the casualty occurred on Sunday, 28 April 2024 and shortly after which efforts also involving other nearby vessles, were made to assist the crew of the FV SEAWIN DIAMOND, while out at sea in an ocean location of approximately 142 nautical miles south of Mossel Bay.\n“MRCC Cape Town was notified at 22:41 on 28 April by Telkom Maritime Radio of a Man Overboard (MOB) reported by the FV SEAWIN DIAMOND. The vessels position was reported to be approximately 142 NM South from Mossel Bay,” said the MRCC on Wednesday.\nIt said: “Whilst the vessel was busy setting fishing gear, the captain was alerted by the crew of the MOB incident and a MOB Marker buoy was deployed.\n“The Namibian citizen was last seen wearing oil skin and boots but not a life jacket. The casualty vessel tracked the marker buoy in an effort to find the person in water (PIW). An observation of something green, presumed to be an oil skin, was seen disappearing under water but it could not be confirmed to be the PIW.\n“A MAYDAY Relay was issued by MRCC Cape Town through Telkom Maritime Radio wherein vessels were requested to divert and render assistance in search of the PIW. The FV BLUEBELL was requested to divert to the reported incident from a position 67NM to the West.\n“MRCC Cape Town developed a search area, based on the environmental factors and the time it would take the BLUEBELL to arrive at the incident location, and assigned a relevant search pattern.\n“The Search Action Plan was communicated to the BLUEBELL, and it conducted a search along the drift track of the MOB buoy while proceeding to the assigned commence search point. MRCC Cape Town was notified by sunset on 29 April that the BLUEBELL and the SEAWIN DIAMOND had completed their search assignments, with MRCC Cape Town issuing revised search instructions to both vessels in preparation for a nighttime search.\n“The nighttime search efforts had to be abandoned due to the lack of night search capabilities of both fishing vessels. MRCC Cape Town requested the frequency of the MAYDAY Relay broadcasted by Telkom Maritime Radio to be increased in the hope that additional resources shall respond.\n“With no response to the MAYDAY Relay by 06:00 on 30 April 2024, the distress message was downscaled to an urgency message notifying vessels of the probable search area wherein sightings relating to the missing crewman could be made.\n“Unfortunately, by 18:00 on 30 April 2024, with no additional information or sighting reports, all SAR efforts were cancelled with the missing person presumed drowned,” reported the MRCC Cape Town.\nThe centre added: “MRCC Cape Town expresses condolences to the family and friends of the missing crew member.”\nEnd\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\nPosted on May 2, 2024 by South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)Posted in Breaking News, Maritime Education, Research & Development, sea rescue, seafarers, shipping, Training & Skills DevelopmentTagged 22 crew members, BLUEBELL, condolences, fishing vessel, FV Oceana Amethyst, FV SEAWIN DIAMOND, life jacket, man over board, Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre, MOB, Namibian family, Namibian fisherman, nighttime search, oil skin and boots, Oliphantsbospunt, presumed drowned, RHIB, Slangkoppunt, Telkom Maritime Radio.\nPost navigation\nPrevious Previous post: SAMSA hosts a bunkering stakeholder engagement roundtable Tuesday with maritime industry key role figuresNext Next post: It’s all systems go for bunkering services in South Africa: SAMSA\nOne thought on “Search for yet another fishing vessel crew member called off near Mossel Bay; condolences extended to Namibian family: SAMSA”\nPingback: Seafarers safety and environmental protection measures under focus on ‘Transport Month’ in South Africa. – The 10th Province\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply\nSearch for:\nRelated Articles\nWreck removal of grounded fishing trawler, FV Elke-M underway in St Francis Bay: SAMSA\nNovember 27, 2024\nA marine court of enquiry to be set up to establish cause of the sinking of a Cape Town fishing vessel, FV Lepanto, with deaths of 11 of its crew members: Dept of Transport\nNovember 14, 2024\nSubsistence fishers boosted with safety gear in Eastern and Western Cape regions: SAMSA\nOctober 31, 2024\nSouth Africa’s Parliament ‘pleased’ by SAMSA’s work, and pledges more resources’ support.\nOctober 18, 2024\nCrew members of casualty fishing vessel, MFV Armana safely back in Cape Town; but vessel missing and presumed sunken: SAMSA\nOctober 14, 2024\nMaritime World\nFacebook\nFacebook\nArchives\nNovember 2024\nOctober 2024\nSeptember 2024\nAugust 2024\nJuly 2024\nMay 2024\nApril 2024\nMarch 2024\nFebruary 2024\nDecember 2023\nNovember 2023\nOctober 2023\nSeptember 2023\nAugust 2023\nJuly 2023\nJune 2023\nMay 2023\nApril 2023\nFebruary 2023\nJanuary 2023\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nAugust 2022\nJuly 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nMarch 2022\nFebruary 2022\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nMeta\nLog in\nEntries feed\nComments feed\nWordPress.org\nPowered by WordPress.com.\nDiscover more from The 10th Province\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\nType your email…\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\n%d",

The steel was divided into three parts.\nThe grounding incident of FV Elke M, a Port Elizabeth registered 376-ton (gross) fishing trawler, measuring 33 meters in length and eight (8) meters wide, with a deadweight tonnage of some 194 tons, occurred on a late Saturday evening on 06 January 2024, on a rocky coastal area of the Cape coast in the Eastern Cape some two kilometres southeast of St Francis Bay.\nWithin hours of the incident, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) assisted in the secure evacuation of all 22 crew members aboard the vessel.\nSalvage work was initiated shortly thereafter to reduce and remove the vessel’s 35 tons of marine fuel and approximately 2000 litres of lubricating oil. Subsequently, in May 2024, after additional evaluations of its disfigured and torn bare structure, which was divided into three sections, it was determined to be temporarily safe during the stormy winter months that began that month.\nA further EIA was conducted in June 2024, followed by the most recent one on whose basis the first phase of the wreck removal has now started.\nMr Nick Sloane\nIn the intervening period, according to the vessel owner’s insurance company, P&I representative, Mr Nick Sloane, to ensure safety of life and the nearby environment, a services provider procured by the vessel owner’s insurers remained posted to monitor the vessel remains’ condition.\nThe monitoring company also collected debris found in the area, and most of which, Mr Sloane said, did not emerge from the bare and broken structure of the FV Elke M. The vigilance would continue through to February 2025 by which period much of what remains of the wreck will possibly have been completely removed.\nOn Thursday, in the presence of SAMSA Southern Region Principal Officer, Mr Thandimfundo Mehlo, the wreck removal team utilised a helicopter to lift and dispose of loose steel parts of the wreck that were ripped off its skeletal structure by the pounding of sea waves during the winter months.\nThis blog chatted briefly with Mr Sloane to establish how far the work has gone, the challenges encountered as well as his impression on the state of readiness of South Africa’s maritime community for incidents of this nature.

Leave a comment\nA marine court of enquiry to be set up to establish cause of the sinking of a Cape Town fishing vessel, FV Lepanto, with deaths of 11 of its crew members: Dept of Transport\nPretoria: 14 November 2024\nA marine court of enquiry is to be set up by the Department of Transport (DoT) to fully establish the cause/s of the sinking of a Cape Town based South African commercial vessel, the FV Lepanto, earlier in 2024 and whose demise cost the lives of 11 crew, while nine (9) others were successfully rescued; the ministry has announced.\nThe launch of the enquiry, according to DoT national spokesman, Mr Colleen Msibi in a statement on Wednesday, follow a submission of a draft preliminary enquiry report by the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) to Transport Minister, Ms Barbara Creecy, and deputy Minister of Transport, Mr Mkhuleko Hlengwa this past weekend.\nThe SAMSA draft report is scheduled to be finalised and released before the end of 2024, said Mr Msibi.\nMr Msibi said: “The Minister of Transport, Ms. Barbara Creecy and the Deputy Minister, Mr Mkhuleko Hlengwa have on Sunday the 10th of November 2024 received a notification from the South African Maritime Authority (SAMSA) indicating that a draft report regarding the tragic sinking of the Fishing Vessel Lepanto, has been completed. The tragic accident happened on 17 May 2024, where eleven lives perished at sea.\n“The Minister and Deputy Minister have requested (the) SAMSA board to urgently finalize the report with its legal team. They have also instructed the Department to begin a process of establishing a Marine Court of Enquiry to further pursue an investigation and bring the report to finality.\n“Creecy and Hlengwa have expressed their strong desire to release the final preliminary report before the end of the year,” said Mr Msibi.\nThe sinking in May 2024 of the 38,6-meters long, 63 years old FV Lepanto, resulting in the tragic loss of lives of 11 crew believed to have remained trapped onboard – the vessel reportedly sank rapidly, within about five (5) minutes after a sudden heavy listing – was one of a handful of sea incidents involving commercial fishing vessels during the year and from which approximately 70 crew members in total were successfully rescued and evacuated.\nThe incidents included a sister commercial vessel to the FV Lepanto, the FV Armana which reportedly had been the first responder to issue a mayday call, as well as rescue and evacuate the nine (9) surviving crew members of the FV Lepanto on 17 May 2024.\nIncidentally, five months later, the FV Armana reportedly also caught fire and sank in October 2024 while out at sea in a location some 60 nautical miles offshore from Gansbaai on the Atlantic Ocean. All its 20 crew members on board were successfully rescued and evacuated back to Cape Town.\nThe two sister commercial fishing vessels’ incidents were interspersed by two others, the grounding of the FV Elke M in January, near St Francis Bay on the Eastern Cape coast (Indian Ocean), and the sinking of the FV Oceana Amethyst approximately 20 nautical miles west north- west of Slangkoppunt on the Altantic Ocean in the Western Cape.\nAll crew on board both vessels (FV Elke M = 22 and FV Oceana Amethyst = 20) were successfully rescued and evacuated.\nEnd.\nPosted on November 14, 2024November 14, 2024 by South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)Posted in Breaking News, Maritime Education, Research & Development, sea rescue, seafarers, shipping, Training & Skills DevelopmentTagged Altantic Ocean, Barbara Creecy, Colleen Msibi, Department of Transport, Deputy Minister of Transport, first responder, FV Elke M, FV Lepanto, FV Oceana Amethyst, marine court of enquiry, mayday call, Minister of Transport, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, preliminary enquiry, rescue and evacuate, South African commercial vessel, South African Maritime Safety Authority, St Francis Bay, surviving crew members. Leave a comment\nSubsistence fishers boosted with safety gear in Eastern and Western Cape regions: SAMSA\nStilbaai: 31 October 2024\nThe plight of South Africa’s subsistence fishing communities is increasingly receiving due attention from government and its agencies, but particularly with both the allocation of more fish species rights, as well as support in terms of enhancing fishing safety, according to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment (DFFE).\nThis emerged this week at a function by the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) to present sets of personal protective and fishing safety gear to members of a rural subsistence cooperative, the Stillcob Joint Primary Corporative in Stilbaai, Western Cape province, on Tuesday.\nSAMSA Head of Corporate Social Investment, Ms Mapitso Dlepu\nThe donation handover was the second of its kind in terms of SAMSA’s Corporate Social Investment and Sustainability project for 2024 – the first having been made a month ago to a Centani, Eastern Cape based 60-member strong rural subsistence fishing cooperative. registered as the Eluthimba Small Scale Fisheries Cooporative.\nAccording to SAMSA head of CSI, Ms Mapitso Dlepu, this year’s corporate social investment shift towards the country’s subsistence fishing community was to galvanise and consolidate state support for sustainable fishing and community development to alleviate poverty and empower subsistence fishing dependent communities.\nThe subsistence fishing cooperatives selected for support this year – both based in SAMSA’s Southern Region that straddles parts of both the Eastern and Western Cape provinces – she said; were provided with basic fishing safety gear following consultation and a needs identification that was conducted jointly with the DFFE fisheries development division.\nPrimarily, the donated equipment was intended to enable the fishermen to fish more efficiently while adhering to safety, she said. According to Ms Dlepu, SAMSA is committed to maintaining ongoing focus of its CSI activity on providing support that promotes and enhances safety of subsistence fisher communities countrywide. For her remarks, click on the video below.\nSAMSA Mossel Bay area Principal Officer, Capt.

progress with the salvage of the grounded Panama-flagged cargo vessel, the MV Ultra Galaxy, currently underway on South Africa’s west coast.\nThe grounding of the vessel in early July occured as the southern hemisphere’s wintry weather fully set in, characterised by choppy winds and rough seas, and amidst several other incidents recorded this year occuring along South Africa’s three oceans, from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Indian Ocean in the east.\nThe incidents – about 22 so far this year since January – included the sinking of no less than two fishing vessels, the FV Oceana Amethystone in April and the FV Lepanto in May both on the west coast- the latter with a sad loss of 11 lives.\nThese were preceded earlier in the year by the grounding of another fishing vessel on the Indian Ocean near St Francis Bay, the Elke M, and also followed by several other incidents involving both a handful of seafarers and more than 200 containers being lost overboard a number of cargo vessels.\nIn Cape Town on Tuesday, South Africa’s Transport Deputy Minister, Mr Hlengwa briefied by SAMSA management on the progress being achieved with the salvage work of the grounded vessel, the MV Ultra Galaxy and who wreck, now in three parts, is still partly submerged in a coastal area some 300 km north of Cape Town.\nAlso present for the deputy Minister’s briefing in Cape Town on Tuesday were Mr Michael Heads, MD of 2Opic and P&I Club representative, Mr Matt Moor, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Claims at Asia Pacific North Standard, Dr Sue Ware of ITOPF as well as officials of the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment.\nMr Hlengwa heard that the MV Ultra Galaxy, a 124.56-meter-long general cargo vessel built in 2008, ran aground on the evening of Tuesday, 09 July 2024, off the coast of Duiwegat, just south of Brand se Baai on the West Coast.\nThis occurred just a day after the vessel, laden with fertiliser cargo from Europe and destined for Dar es Salaam in Tanzania was abandoned by its 18 member Pilipino crew after it had listed heavily while sailing south on the Atlantic Ocean a day before.\nOn its grounding, the initial effort by South African authorities as constituted by the country’s Incident Management Organisation (IMOrg) under the Department of Transport, focussed primarily on retrieving all cargo on board, consisting of the fertiliser as well as fuel on board.\nHowever, this effort was virtually stillborn since just as soon as salvage started, it was immediately thwarted by extreme wintry weather conditions, leading to the fertiliser dissolving on exposure to sea water, and about 500 metric tons of low sulphur fuel and hydraulic oils spilling out and mostly washed ashore onto nearby beaches.\nA clean-up operation that initially began with floating debris, ensued; expanding fully onto the oil and low sulphur fuel spill that was collected successfully for disposal.\nMost recently, SAMSA confirmed that a tender process for the retrieval and removal of the wreck was already at an advanced stage of finalisation, after which the preferred services provider will be appointed to formally start with the work.\nMinisterial Briefing: Mr Mahesk Fakir, SAMSA Board chairperson (standing) briefing Transport Deputy Minister, Mr Mkhuleko Hlengwa (seated, second from the right) in Cape Town on Tuesday, 08 October 2024, on progress being made with the salvage work of the grounded MV Ultra Galaxy lying in pieces on South Africa’s west coast since early July 2024.\nIn his briefing of the Deputy Minister of Transport, SAMSA’s Board chairperson, Mr Mahesh Fakir, reiterated the entity’s full commitment to its legislated mandate of ensuring safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment, with critical focus on its safety mandate.\nCrucially however, he said: “As we look into the future, we must ask ourselves, how do we sustainably fund and maintain the capacity to prevent such incidents in the future.” Also important, he said, was greater support and collaboration with both the maritime sector and industry as well as other state departments and entities.\nRegarding the salvage of the MV Ultra Galaxy, he said the plan was to have both the wreck and removed and the affected natural environment rehabilitated to its original condition.\nIn response, Mr Hlengwa thanked both SAMSA, the DFFE and industry principals and experts for their continued keen involvement and contribution to the work of SAMSA, and by extention, that of the Department of Transport and government.\n“It is our belief that together, we can promote South Africa’s maritime interests and contribute to a safer, cleaner and more sustainable oceans environment; and I invite you to engage with us with any ideas that you might have in order to take this work forward,” said Mr Hlengwa.\nFor their brief remarks, click on video below.\nPhilippines Ambassador visits SAMSA\nPrior to the briefing of the South Africa deputy Minister of Transport, Mr Hlengwa on Tuesday, SAMSA’s Southern Region management in Gqeberha also hosted Philippines’ Ambassador to South Africa, Ms Noralyn Jubaira Baja for a courtesy visit that centred on strengthening of relations between the two countries with regards the safety and welfare of seafarers.\nAll 18 crew members of the MV Ultra Galaxy who were safely evacuated and expatriated were Phillipinos. In a brief interview shortly after the meeting, Ms Baja described the visit and meeting as a routine,intended primarily to firm up relations with SAMSA regional offices spread across South Africa’s coastline from Richards Bay in the east to Port Nolloth in the west, with a view to ensuring the safety and welfare of Philipino seafarers worldwide.\nHer schedule in the city would also involve a visit of a vessel at Algoa Bay with Philipino crew members.

Leave a comment\nSearch on for more containers fallen off a cargo vessel sailing past South Africa this week: SAMSA\nPretoria: 04 October 2024\nThe South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) says it has embarked on yet another search for a set of containers lost overboard by an international cargo vessel while sailing along the country’s oceans earlier this week.\nHowever, the set of containers lost overboard by a Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) vessel, the MV MSC Taranto, while sailing past South Africa, are empty. In the wake of the incident, SAMSA has issued a navigational warning to vessels traversing the oceans nearby to be on the look-out, and to report any sightings.\nIn a statement in Pretoria on Friday, SAMSA said: “The South African Maritime Safety Authority has been alerted to the loss of five empty containers from the MV MSC Taranto, which occurred between 01:00 and 04:00 local time on the 2nd of October 2024.\n“The vessel, which is currently en-route to Colombo, Sri Lanka, reported that the containers – two (2) yellow and three (3) red -were lost at sea. The exact location of the containers is reported to be have been along the west coast between Mossel Bay and stillbaai.\n“SAMSA, in collaboration with other relevant authorities, is actively working on locating and recovering the containers. A navigational warning has been issued to all vessels traversing the west coast of South Africa to be on alert for the floating containers, which pose a potential hazard to maritime navigation.\n“Mariners and the public are urged to immediately report any sightings of the containers to local authorities or the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) on 021 938 3300.\nFurther updates will be provided as recovery efforts continue.\nMV MSC Apollo released\nMeanwhile, SAMSA also confirmed the official release of another MSC vessel, the MV MSC Apollo that had been berthed in Algoa Bay for more than a week following an oil spill incident which since been contained.\nSaid SAMSA: “The MV MSC Apollo has been allowed to depart from Algoa Bay anchorage after she was detained following an oil spill in the bay on the 7th of September. A root cause investigation was completed by the vessel’s owners in conjunction with the Classification Society and endorsed by the vessel’s Flag State.\n“This investigation resulted in one of the overboard discharges being blanked off and the sea chest strainer cleaned by a local dive company, in difficult conditions at the anchorage. No other damages have been found on the ship’s side structure during the diving inspection.\n“The vessel will proceed to her next port of call, where a more thorough internal inspection of the sea chests can be conducted, while in port, by her owners,” said SAMSA.\nRegarding the impacts of the oil spill in Algoa Bay, SAMSA said: “The oil spill affected the penguin population on St Croix Island and 13 oiled penguins were captured on the island by SANPARKS rangers and transported to the local SANCOBB rehabilitation facility.\n“Very early in the incident one (1) penguin had died due to being in poor condition. The staff at SANCOBB have washed nine (9) penguins to date [with] two (2) more needing additional care before being washed.\n“A lightly oiled penguin did not need washing but is being kept with the other penguins and these birds are expected to be released within the next two (2) weeks provided that they pass all their health checks,” said SAMSA.\n“The SANPARKS rangers are scheduled to conduct a final inspection of St Croix Island on Saturday to check for any oiled penguins that may have been missed during their visits to the island group” said SAMSA.\nMeanwhile, SAMSA also confirmed that the vessel owners had co-operated with the Authorities by paying the fines that were issued and provided a letter of undertaking to cover all reasonable cost of the clean up and penguin rehabilitation.\n“These costs are being monitored by ITOPF (International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited) to ensure fairness,” said SAMSA.\nEnd\nPosted on October 4, 2024October 4, 2024 by South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)Posted in Breaking News, Maritime Education, Research & Development, sea rescue, seafarers, shipping, Training & Skills DevelopmentTagged Algoa Bay, Classification Society, containers lost overboard, floating containers, International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited, maritime navigation, Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, MSC Taranto, MV MSC Apollo, navigational warning, oil spill, penguins, potential hazard, rangers, rehabilitation facility, SANCOBB, SANPARKS, South African Maritime Safety Authority, St. Croix Island.

Leave a comment\nSAMSA ramps up efforts to collect debris from containers lost overboard vessels on the Indian Ocean\nPretoria: 22 September 2024\nWith several dozens of  containers having fallen off cargo vessels on the country’s eastern seaboard recently, due to bad wintry weather, and some of their contents – including pharmaceutical material – now washing up on hundreds of kilometres of the Indian Ocean coastline, the South African Maritime Safety Authority SAMSA) has ramped up collection efforts.\nSAMSA, in a statement on Friday afternoon said: “The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)  is currently in the process of coordinating the cleanup and recovery of shipping containers, flotsam, associated pollutants, and products washing ashore along the South-East coastline of South Africa between the Wild Coast and Mossel Bay.\n“This follows the loss of containers from at least three vessels over the past six weeks due to adverse weather conditions. In addition to the flotsam, SAMSA is closely monitoring pharmaceutical bottles containing pills that continue to wash ashore.\n“The public is urged not to consume these items under any circumstances as they may pose serious health risks.”\nSAMSA announced that working in collaboration with relevant authorities and the owners of the affected vessel; a monitoring, recovery and clean-up plan had been rolled out across the affected area.\n“Environmental cleaning companies, Extreme Projects and SpillTech, have been appointed to lead the clean-up efforts. They have set up collection points for debris washing ashore, and the public is encouraged to call the toll-free number 063 404 2128 to report sightings of containers, pharmaceutical bottles, or other debris and to obtain information on the location of drop-off points.\n“Members of the public can also report sightings to their local municipality or contact the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) on 021 938 3300,” said SAMSA\nUpdate on other related incidents\nOil spill: Algoa Bay\nMeanwhile in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, the cleaning up of an oil spill off a cargo vessel currently berthed in Algoa Bay continues, while an investigation into the cause is underway, SAMSA reported of the incident that occured earlier in September 2024.\nShortly after the oil spill discovery, SAMSA confirmed that a handful of penguins in the vicinity were found to have been oiled, and had been evacuated for cleaning.\nSaid SAMSA: “On 10 September, (Monday) SANParks rangers accessed St. Croix Island and identified six oiled penguins—three heavily oiled and three lightly oiled. The penguins were captured and transported to the local SANCCOB facility for treatment. However, two additional oiled penguins evaded capture. Efforts are ongoing to locate and capture them.\n“Further wildlife surveillance in the area is being coordinated with SANCCOB. The public is urged to report any sightings of oiled birds to SANCCOB, and any oiled mammals should be reported to Bayworld officials. Surveillance and monitoring of the affected areas will continue, weather permitting, to mitigate any environmental impact.”\nAs of the past week, indications by the incident management committee of the Incident Management Organisation (IMOrg) led by SAMSA and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment (DFFE) were that the oil spill had since been successfully contained and cleaned up, with daily monitoring of the coastline in Algoa Bay returning reports of no further oil spill residue spotted. Additionally, no further wild life was found as affected.\nThe vessel involved remains in Algoa Bay while an investigation into the incident is underway.\nSmoke on cargo vessel : Richards Bay\nA cargo vessel, the MV Measrk Cincinatti had to be berthed in Richards Bay a Sunday ago after smoke was detected onboard, both SAMSA and the vessel owner representatives confirmed.\nIn a brief report, A.P Moller-Maersk Indian Subcontinent, Middle East & Africa senior Media Relations Officer, Adhish Alawani stated: “We can confirm that smoke was reported from a cargo hold on one of our time-chartered vessels, Maersk Cincinnati, around midnight local South African time on September 15, 2024, while the vessel was sailing from Colombo to Port Tanger Med.\n“Maersk Cincinnati is a 15,500 TEU vessel operating on the AE7 service and flies the Hong Kong flag. There were no visible flames, and the temperature in the cargo hold remained under control. Smoke is no longer visible. The crew immediately responded and initiated the required safety protocols on the vessel.\n“The ship owners have reported that all the crew members are safe and accounted for. The vessel owners are in touch with the crew to ensure they receive all possible support. The vessel is in stable condition, with all machinery, steering and navigational equipment fully operational,” said Mr Alawani\nGrounded MV Ultra Galaxy wreck removal progress, West Coast.\nThe monitoring of the wreck of the Panama-flagged general cargo vessel, the MV Ultra Galaxy, as well as the location of its surroundings on South Africa’s west coast on the Atlantic Ocean continues, pending the formal appointment of salvors to retrieve the vessel’s remains from the shoreline.\nIn a brief statement this past week, SAMSA confirmed that the tender period for the removal of the wreck had recently been closed with the vessel owner’s insurers, P&I and salvage experts now engagedd with assessment of the tenders received. “Once done, the preferred options will be presented to SAMSA for consideration,” read the statement.\nIn terms of the conditions on location of the wreck, SAMSA said: “The situation is the same with no significant change in the wreck or her position. In terms of clean up of the oil spill, the response teams remain on the beaches with a huge team to ensure that any, and all debris or oily recharge – even as very minor at this stage – is picked up.”\nEnd.\nPosted on September 22, 2024September 22, 2024 by South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA)Posted in Breaking NewsLeave a comment\nPosts navigation\nOlder posts\nSearch for:\nRelated Articles\nWreck removal of grounded fishing trawler, FV Elke-M underway in St Francis Bay: SAMSA\nNovember 27, 2024\nA marine court of enquiry to be set up to establish cause of the sinking of a Cape Town fishing vessel, FV Lepanto, with deaths of 11 of its crew members: Dept of Transport\nNovember 14, 2024\nSubsistence fishers boosted with safety gear in Eastern and Western Cape regions: SAMSA\nOctober 31, 2024\nSouth Africa’s Parliament ‘pleased’ by SAMSA’s work, and pledges more resources’ support.\nOctober 18, 2024\nCrew members of casualty fishing vessel, MFV Armana safely back in Cape Town; but vessel missing and presumed sunken: SAMSA\nOctober 14, 2024\nMaritime World\nFacebook\nFacebook\nSearch for:\nArchives\nNovember 2024\nOctober 2024\nSeptember 2024\nAugust 2024\nJuly 2024\nMay 2024\nApril 2024\nMarch 2024\nFebruary 2024\nDecember 2023\nNovember 2023\nOctober 2023\nSeptember 2023\nAugust 2023\nJuly 2023\nJune 2023\nMay 2023\nApril 2023\nFebruary 2023\nJanuary 2023\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nAugust 2022\nJuly 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nMarch 2022\nFebruary 2022\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nMeta\nLog in\nEntries feed\nComments feed\nWordPress.org\nPowered by WordPress.com.\nLoading Comments...\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite",

When the ambulance arrived, he was taken to hospital but was later pronounced dead by the attending doctor.\nThe fishing vessel had made a stop at the terminal as Sowder began experiencing difficulties and collapsed.\nThe circumstances surrounding his death are now being investigated by the police, but officials from the RCIPS said in a press release Thursday evening that there are no suspicious circumstances at this time.\nShare your vote!\nNo, thanks.\nComments (5)\nTrackback URL | Comments RSS Feed\nAnonymous says:\n27/04/2024 at 11:50 am\nI trust Customs searched the boat (from Panama, after all) thoroughly for drugs or other contraband items???\n4\n10\nReply\nAnonymous says:\n28/04/2024 at 7:52 pm\nNo, they most likely ignored all standard CBP protocols for a foreign flagged vessel and let them land and go with no official documentation.

I saw over 40 people that were beaten to pulp by the insurgents in Daban Wanza and Tumun Barebari. They seized over hundred boats from the fishermen. SPONSOR AD  “They used speed boats in rounding up the fishermen’s canoes, merged them in one canoe and led them to the river bank. None of the fishermen made it out with even a single tool,” he said.   Invest time, resources for nation’s economic growth – Commissioner Kano govt justifies N854m for mass weddings as palliativesOne of those wounded, Malam Murtala, told our correspondent that they were first rounded up by Boko Haram fighters loyal to Abubakar Shekau, who handed a stern warning to them to stop paying royalty to ISWAP. “They claimed to be the original owners of the area, not ISWAP, and that anybody that violates that would pay with his life. However, before they finished talking to us, the ISWAP fighters arrived and started shooting. “All the fishermen, about 50 of us, dived into the lake to escape the clash, but two people were killed. Thank God I escaped alive though with a bullet lodged in my buttock, while another brushed my chin.“Later on, the ISWAP said all the fishing canoes we left behind: almost 100 boats have been seized for being informants to security and aiding their members to escape and surrender to the military,” he said.Murtala said dozens of insurgents were killed during the clash, adding that “The shooting continued after we left the place. I learnt that dozens of them died during the clash but the ISWAP have superior firearms.Another witness, who escaped the attack unhurt but preferred to be named Garba, said the boats seized by the insurgents had kept over 2,000 fishermen in serious hardship.He said the fishermen taxed by the ISWAP to fish in Tirigulla, Duguri, Kuyiram, Musaram and Kilma were all sacked.“These are communities that produce at least one trailer per week. It’s the heart of fishing and farming in the Lake Chad area.“For us that operate at the Lake Chad fringes of Monguno, Marte and Ngala, we paid the insurgents N40,000 for Taro (dredging nets fixture), giving them one-third of our daily catch and N3,000 per every Rothmans carton of fish loaded on a trailer to Maiduguri.“They seized over 100 canoes, 5,000 Gura (Malian traps), dredging nets and gill nets that are worth millions of naira. They would tell you to drop everything, including your slippers and leave,” he said.Garba said the insurgents have made fishing in the Lake Chad a feat for only those who dare, “but it’s the only occupation we have since childhood, and we have large families to feed. So, for many of us, it’s worth making sacrifices for.“What happened today has taken us back several years in the progress we recorded in fishing here,” he said.Another fisherman, Mamman Labo, said there were over 144 settlements in the Lake Chad area that had been annexed by the insurgents.“Currently, we only have people in Doron Baga, Bundaram, Fish Dam in Kukawa and Wilgo in Ngala local government areas.He called on the military to go beyond protecting their formations in the Lake Chad area and take the war to the insurgents.“For many years, the military has been here, the Navy occupying the Fish Dam, while Baga, Bundaram and Wilgo are manned by the military, but without any advancement. “We, the residents, are calling on the military to take the war to the insurgents and we will give them every support in taking the war to the insurgents. Because we don’t know how we can survive without fishing,” he said.

Armand Balilo told CNN affiliate CNN Philippines in a TV interview.\nBalilo said the oil tanker was in the area during the time of the collision and authorities were still collecting evidence.\nThe South China Sea is a 1.3 million-square-mile waterway that’s vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. That means huge container ships and oil tankers routinely sail through the region.\nThe sea is also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend on, often using much smaller vessels.\nUp to 85% of all maritime accidents are a result of navigation hazards and poorly regulated commercial operations that continue to pose risks to shipping and undermine the security environment, said John Bradford, international affairs fellow in Indonesia for the Council on Foreign Relations.\nSuch incidents are particularly common in Southeast Asia, where crews are often mistreated and under trained, he added, citing the Information Fusion Centre in Singapore, which has counted 1,882 individuals as dead or missing at sea in the first half of 2023.\n“Sometimes the collisions, even those resulting in death, aren’t reported because there is a lack of trust in the authorities or fear of prosecution for the collision or other activities. This speaks to the overall governance problem,” Bradford said.\nPhotos released by the Philippine coast guard show the scene at Barangay Cato on October 3.\nPhilippine Coast Guard\nThe South China Sea is also a major maritime flashpoint.\nBracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the sea are claimed by multiple governments, with Beijing asserting ownership over almost all of the waterway, in defiance of an international court ruling.\nOver the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.\nScarborough Shoal, known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines and Huangyan Island in China, is a small but strategic reef and fishing ground 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of Luzon that has been a major source of tensions between Manila and Beijing.\nRichard Heydarian, senior lecturer in international relations at the University of the Philippines’ Asian Center, said that even if this incident did not directly involve China, the territorial disputes may have had an indirect influence.\n“The reality is that China has structural culpability for what’s happening because of China’s bullying and various means of preventing Filipino fishermen from accessing traditional fishing grounds. What’s happening here is that [Filipino fishermen are] being pushed farther and farther into the high seas,” Heydarian said.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry has defended the behavior of its vessels in the waterway and said Beijing will “firmly safeguard” what it views as its territorial sovereignty.\nThe area has witnessed increasingly frequent run-ins between Philippine vessels and tiny wooden fishing boats against much larger Chinese coast guard ships and what Manila says are shadowy Chinese “maritime militia” fishing vessels.\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. Manila says Beijing has ignored the ruling.\nCNN’s Brad Lendon contributed reporting.\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nListen\nWatch\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nUS Politics\nSCOTUS\nCongress\nFacts First\n2024 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nFear & Greed\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nNightcap\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nFootball\nTennis\nGolf\nMotorsport\nUS Sports\nOlympics\nClimbing\nEsports\nHockey\nScience\nSpace\nLife\nUnearthed\nClimate\nSolutions\nWeather\nWeather\nVideo\nClimate\nUkraine-Russia War\nIsrael-Hamas War\nFeatures\nAs Equals\nCall to Earth\nFreedom Project\nImpact Your World\nInside Africa\nCNN Heroes\nWatch\nLive TV\nCNN Fast\nShows A-Z\nCNN10\nCNN Max\nCNN TV Schedules\nListen\nCNN 5 Things\nChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nOne Thing\nTug of War\nCNN Political Briefing\nThe Axe Files\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nAll CNN Audio podcasts\nAbout CNN\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nWorld\nWatch\nListen\nLive TV\nFollow CNN\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Furthermore, NLNG is actively engaging with the passenger boat operator and the protesting communities, Amadi-Ama and Koko-Ama, with the aim of reaching a peaceful resolution.”“The engagement has led to the removal of the blockade.”“NLNG urges for calm during the ongoing investigation and resolution process. The company is committed to addressing the concerns raised and working towards a peaceful outcome for all parties involved.”Share this:TweetWhatsAppLike this:Like Loading...Tags: #elanhub.netNLNGRivers State  Previous PostBreaking: Burna Boy to Perform at the 66th Grammys   Next PostOPEN HEAVEN 23 January 2024: Friends Stronger Than Brothers    Stanley Uhegbu      Next Post    OPEN HEAVEN 23 January 2024: Friends Stronger Than Brothers  Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Nantu Khan went missing in the sea during Cyclone MidhiliProthom AloA total of 25 fishermen from two fishing trawlers that sank in the Bay of Bengal due to Cyclone Midhili remain missing even after 20 days. The families of these fishermen are enduring days of worry and anxiety, with some facing dire circumstances as the primary breadwinners are still missing.  According to the Barguna District Trawler Owners Association, in early November, 17 fishermen set out to the Bay of Bengal for fishing in a trawler named FB Elahi Bharasa, owned by Rafiqul Islam in the Charduani area of Patharghata in Barguna.  On 17 November, all the fishermen aboard that trawler went missing after being hit by Cyclone Midhili. Additionally, a trawler named FB Mayer Doa of Patharghata, which had gone fishing in the sea a few days before the cyclone, sank on 17 November in a storm. Eight fishermen aboard that trawler also went missing. Out of the 17 fishermen missing from FB Elahi Bharasa, 16 are from Barguna Sadar Upazila. Among them, seven are from Gazi Mahmud village in Naltona union, and nine are from Dhalua Union.  Salma Begum, the wife of the missing fisherman Md Liton Howlader, 42, from Barguna Sadar Upazila Naltona Union, said, \"My husband left home to fish in the sea a week before the storm. The day before the storm, I spoke with him on the phone for the last time. Since then, there is no trace of him. I lost my husband.\" Hasib, the son of Monir Hossain, another missing fisherman from Naltona Union, shared, \"We talked with my father the day before the cyclone. My father was the sole earner in our family. Currently, we have to go through a lot of difficulties.\" Golam Mostafa Chowdhury, president of the Barguna District Trawler Owners Association, has conveyed that no trace of the missing fishermen was discovered during Cyclone Midhili. The fate of the trawler named MV Mayer Doa, and whether it sank in the sea due to the storm, remains uncertain. Similarly, it is unclear whether the trawler named Elahi Bharasa floated to India or sank.  UNO Shamim Mia of Barguna Sadar has stated that there is no trace of the missing fishermen in the aftermath of Cyclone Midhili. It is not possible to determine whether they are alive or dead. The list of missing fishermen has been submitted to the office of the Deputy Commissioner. Follow the Google news channel to get Prothom Alo's latest newsRead more from BangladeshCycloneBargunaFishermen",

Mr. Chang of Cheh Yng Marine Products Company Limited, confirmed neither the Captain or 1st Officer of the vessel had received specialist medical training nor had any previous experience of dealing with Tuberculosis.\nIn Mr. Assidiq’s final days, the 1st Officer of the vessel explained to the court that he had instructed Mr. Assidiq “to rest” after complaints of a swollen ankle, and made temperature and diet checks on his colleague, but that these checks were not recorded.\nIn her final assessments examining the issue of neglect, Mrs. Whitby stated that no action had been taken to provide the “appropriate medical help” to Mr. Assidiq, but there was no evidence to suggest the crew management responsible for his health “knew” his illness was “potentially fatal”. Meaning, it would therefore “not be logically possible” to identify neglect as a factor in the case.\nMr. Chang, as General Manager of the Taiwanese Shipping Company, spoke of plans to provide more TB training for their Captains and 1st Officers as well as introduce improved medical equipment on board.\nChief Medical Officer Dr. Rebecca Edwards also recommended an increased use of “early warning” report forms on board vessels, to help medical workers in Stanley respond to future “treatable” medical emergencies.\nConcluding her inquiry, Mrs. Whitby expressed her condolences to the family of Mr. Assidiq.\nShare this\nPrevPreviousSupreme Court | Judicial Review\nNextSummary Court | Mr H OyarzoNext\nLatest in Court\nSummary Court | Mr Alfonso Hobman\nFebruary 16, 2022\nSummary Court | Mr L Clarke\nJanuary 12, 2022\nSummary Court | Mr I Ford\nJanuary 12, 2022\nSummary Court | Mr I Ford\nDecember 7, 2021\nSummary Court | Mr M Gilbert\nDecember 1, 2021\nOther News\nGreen Building Practices in The Falklands\nJanuary 28, 2025\nFuture Housing Developments Discussed in New Focus Group\nJanuary 28, 2025\nFalklands Volleyball Club Training For First International Competition\nJanuary 27, 2025\nConcerns Raised Over Cost of Electricity in The Falklands\nJanuary 27, 2025\nMLA Jack Ford wants to remove private rentals properties from the contractor housing pool\nJanuary 24, 2025\nHave a story?\nGet in touch if there is something you’d like us to cover.\nContact\nnews@fitv.co.fk\nJobs\nViewers Charter\nSubscription T&Cs\nPrivacy Policy\n© 2025 | Falkland Islands Television\nMade with\n♥\nin the Falkland Islands\nWebsite by Tonedog Designs\nCurrent Affairs\nEnvironment\nHistory\nLifestyle\nSport\nCurrent Affairs\nEnvironment\nHistory\nLifestyle\nSport\nFeatures\nFalklands In Focus\nTalking Point\nFalklands In Focus\nTalking Point\nMore from FITV\nAbout\nMeet the Team\nServices\nContact\nAbout\nMeet the Team\nServices\nContact\nJobs\nViewers Charter\nJobs\nViewers Charter\nFollow us\nFacebook-f\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nSpotify\nSoundcloud",

He was arrested near the international maritime border while fishing in the Arabian Sea.\nAccording to officials, Sosa died of heart failure on October 25 while in the jail in Karachi. The body was handed over to the Indian authorities at the Attari border in Punjab and flown to Ahmedabad from where it was transported to Nanavada village by road on Sunday night.\nSosa, along with other fishermen, was intercepted by the Pakistan Marines while fishing off the Porbandar coast and taken to Karachi, said Ashish Vaghela, the Fisheries Officer from Porbandar. “The provisional postmortem report provided by Pakistani authorities confirmed that Sosa died of heart failure,” he said.\nSosa’s sentence was completed in July 2021. Still, he was not released, despite a 2008 bilateral agreement between India and Pakistan stipulating that such convicts should be repatriated within a month of serving their sentence and after their nationality is confirmed, said activist Jatin Desai, who has been working for the welfare of Indian fishermen. According to Desai, five Indian fishermen died in Pakistani custody in 2023, and three have died so far this year. Over the past decade, a total of 26 fishermen have lost their lives in Pakistani jails, Desai said. He said 212 fishermen, mostly from Gujarat, and some from Maharashtra and Diu, are currently lodged in Pakistani jails.\nURL:  https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/gujarat-body-of-31-yr-old-fisherman-who-died-in-pak-jail-transported-to-state-9690252/\nICSF\nInternational Collective  in Support of Fishworkers\nNews\nYemaya Newsletter\nSAMUDRA Report\nOUR WORK\nRight to Resources\nGender in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nDisasters and Climate Change\nDecent Work\nFisheries Trade\nAquaculture\nBiodiversity\nAbout ICSF\nSSF Guidelines\nICSF Campaigns\nResources\nICSF Archives\nSign-up for News Alerts\n×\nName*\nEmail*\nPlease tell us about your work  This helps us network better\nNature of Work\nCountry*\nAfghanistan\nAfghanisthan\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerica\nAmerican Samoa\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands/India\nAndaman Nicobar Islands/India\nAndhra Pradesh\nAndhra Pradesh/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Odisha/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu/Puducherry\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArctic Ocean\nArgentina\nArunachal Pradesh/India\nASEAN\nAsia\nAssam/India\nAustralia\nAustralia.

His aunt, Winsome Malabre, said the family was still clinging to hope.\n“Even now, I’m just looking to see him walking in the yard. The family is really shocked and we’re just hoping and wishing that he would just come home. We’re not taking it good at all,” Malabre told The Gleaner on Monday.\nBarbara Graham of the Portland Cottage Citizens’ Association told The Gleaner that the men were active members of the community and their disappearance has shocked fellow residents.\nRecounting her last encounter with Robert Weir, Graham said, “The last time I saw him, we were together at a function, and he was the representative from my community, and he was there giving his input at a mangrove project meeting and how it affects them in terms of fishing, etcetera.”\nAnyone knowing the whereabouts of the men is asked to contact the Lionel Town police at 876-986-3233, police emergency at 119, or the nearest police station.\nThe men’s disappearance follows the April 2020 case of four men from the neighbouring communities of Rocky Point and Race Course who went missing.

It completely sank underwater as of Thursday 9 a.m.           The KCG launched an underwater rescue and search on Thursday at noon based on the identified location of the ship.           “The authorities are open to all possibilities regarding cause of the accident,” an official from the KCG said.             On the same day, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced that a total of 3,092 marine accidents happened last year. Some 94 people died or went missing due to such accidents last year.     BY LEE SOO-JUNG, HYEON YE-SEUL [[email protected]]\nKorea\nFishing boat\nTongyeong\nKorea Coast Guard\nSearch and Rescue\nSinking\nSouth Gyeongsang\nMore in Social Affairs\nMajor highways remain congested on Lunar New Year; traffic expected to ease in evening\nNo. of injured victims from Busan airplane fire rises to 7, all with minor injuries\nAir Busan plane on fire at Gimhae International Airport: fire authorities\nSick during the Lunar New Year?

The crew reported that they were capsizing off Couverden Point, about 60 nautical miles south of Haines. The crew dropped out of contact, and no further responses were heard over VHF. Shortly after, the Coast Guard received an alert from the Wind Walker's EPIRB at a position in Icy Strait.\nThe Coast Guard did not get a definite count on the number of crewmembers aboard, but people who knew the vessel reported that there should have been five fisherman working on Wind Walker at the time. The count has not been confirmed.\nSector Southeast Alaska issued an urgent broadcast and dispatched a helicopter aircrew from Coast Guard Air Station Sitka, along with a response boat from Station Juneau to search the area.\nThe Alaska Marine Highway ferry Hubbard overheard the broadcast and diverted to assist, and she was the first on scene. In heavy snow and winds of up to 50 knots, the ferry and the Coast Guard responders began a search. Seven cold-water immersion suits and two strobe lights were located in the water in the search area, but no crewmembers.\nHubbard departed the search area midmorning and continued on her commercial voyage, according to AIS data provided by Pole Star. Coast Guard Cutter Healy arrived in the search area at about the same time, replacing Hubbard.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore released the details after it received information from the China Maritime Safety Administration.\nAccording to the reports, the accident took place a week ago on December 26 when the new bunker tanker was making its way from Chenghan Jiao in Northern China to Zhoushan. The vessel was built for Consort Bunkers which has operations in both Singapore and Zhoushan. It is unclear from the reports if the tanker may have been on her delivery run from the shipyard to her home base in China or if the plans called for her to proceed to Singapore.\nThe 7,999 dwt tanker Pearl Kenzo was built for Consort as part of the bunker company’s expansion effort. The new vessel is 377 feet (115 meters) in length with a reported top speed of 12 knots. She was underway on December 26 when shortly after midnight she collided with a Chinese-flagged fishing vessel Suiyupu 0183.\nThe China Maritime Safety Administration organized a search and rescue mission. They informed the MPA that the fishing boat had sunk and eight crewmembers were missing. The crew of the bunker vessel was reported uninjured.\nThe vessel had just completed construction earlier in the month at Jinglu Shipbuilding. The naming and handover ceremony took place on December 18. The shipyard highlighted the ship has unique capabilities with a special coating for its tanks that gives it extra versatility in its cargo operations. It can load up to 9,000 cubic meters and also adopts a double-hull structure for its tanks for increased safety and environmental security. It was apparently traveling without cargo at the time of the collision and there are no reports of environmental spills from the accident.\nThe Chinese officials are reporting that after the accident the bunker vessel has remained anchored at Shidao in northern China while the investigation is underway.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

On Saturday, the vessel was operating about 12 nautical miles off Eastbourne, England in rough weather when Vandewalle fell over the side.\nHis crewmates initiated a rescue and called the UK Coastguard for help. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station in Eastborne received the call just before midnight and quickly dispatched their volunteer-crewed response boat, the Esme Anderson, to join the search.\nThe Jerki's crew conducted their own search pattern for Vandewalle, though they were hampered by onboard mechanical troubles. In darkness, driving rain and waves of up to 12 feet, the small trawler's crew managed to find the helmsman in the water. They recovered him aboard the vessel, but he succumbed to hypothermia.\nThe RNLI lifeboat stood down and returned to its station once the Jerki had Vandewalle aboard; the trawler returned to port at Oostende, Belgium to deliver the victim's body to shore.\nThe public prosecutor's office in West Flanders, Belgium has started an investigation into how Vandewalle went over the side, but at this point officials are treating the casualty as an accident, according to The Fishing Daily.\nJerki's operating company, Aude Audenda, issued a brief statement commemorating Vandewalle's life and expressing sympathy for his loved ones. \"Out of respect for the family and our crew, we want to let them process this tragic accident in peace,\" the firm said. \"We can only stress that Glenn was a well-liked and experienced fisherman, a fisherman through and through.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

A substantial search effort was launched, and eleven good samaritan fishing vessels answered the call for assistance. One of them was a Russian-flagged trawler, the Norskehavet.\nCoordinated by Norwegian authorities and the Norwegian patrol vessel Barentshav, this fleet fanned out in a line and swept the area in a deliberate search pattern. Two helicopters joined the operation as well.\nConditions were difficult, with strong winds and rough waves, according to the rescue center. No sign of the missing fisherman was found overnight, and the search was called off Wednesday afternoon.\nA crisis team was activated to assist the crew of the Langenes and the family of the victim.\n\"We have had the worst possible outcome of this tragic event,\" said Tore Roaldsnes, the general manager of operator Bluewild AS, speaking to Fiskeribladet. The company extended its condolences to the family of the victim and its thanks to the many vessels that helped out with the search.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

The crew reported that a crewmember was unresponsive and lifeless, and asked for a medevac. A helicopter flew the victim to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nWeather in the North Sea was foul at the time, and it was not safe for the Inger Katrine to return to port in Thyboron, nor was it practical for the authorities to board the vessel to investigate. She finally entered the harbor on Wednesday, and local police arrested her crew at the pier. The vessel and a fish hold full of plaice were detained while investigators scoured the ship for clues.\nOn Thursday, a local court heard charges that the crew had killed their crewmate by means of assault and strangulation. The coroner's autopsy report laid out details consistent with a violent attack, including bruising, bleeding in the throat, three fractured vertebrae and bleeding in the eyes from burst capillaries, according to TV Midvest.\nThe closed-door hearing lasted all day, and in the evening, the court ordered all five men held in custody for four weeks, in line with a request from prosecutors. All of the accused have pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, and they have appealed the court's detention ruling.\nLocal media have identified the victim as Alf Villum Jensen, 41. His widow, Louise Villum Jensen, told local media that Alf was nervous before this trip.\n\"He had never met that crew before, but he said they had told him that in the last year they had never had a new man last more than a fortnight. I tried to cheer him up, said that it would be fine, because he was good at that. But I could tell he knew it wasn't going to go well,\" she told Dagbladet Ringkobing Skjern.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

On Monday afternoon, she reported a serious flooding incident at a position about 200 miles to the east of the port. As rescue assets mobilized to the scene, the situation on board deteriorated, and the crew was forced to abandon ship into their life rafts. The vessel sank after they departed.\nThe British Forces South Atlantic Islands (BFSAI) responded by launching a long-range search aircraft, which located the rafts and kept watch on their position. A fisheries patrol vessel and two Good Samaritan fishing vessels also diverted to assist. The BFSAI attempted to launch a helicopter rescue mission later that night, but the flight had to be canceled because of severe and worsening weather conditions. Argentine outlet InfoBae reports that significant wave heights were as high as 25 feet.\nAccording to Spanish media, multiple crewmembers died in the accident. A Falkland Islands patrol vessel rescued 13 crewmembers from one raft, and a Good Samaritan fishing vessel rescued one survivor and recovered one deceased crewmember from a second raft. Seven other bodies were recovered as of Tuesday night, making eight fatalities and 14 known survivors in total. Five crewmembers remain missing.\nThe Falkland Islands government has not confirmed the details of the rescue operation, but said in a statement Tuesday that \"a number\" of crewmembers had been rescued. The search for the missing is still under way.\nArgos Georgia was a 160-foot freezer longliner built in Turkey.

The vessel's sinking claimed the life of the skipper.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the fishing vessel Bahía la Isleta was struck by a wave and capsized at a position about one mile offshore. The local office of the Guardia Civil received a call about the casualty at 1400 and notified the agency's maritime service. A rescue helicopter with a two-man dive team was dispatched quickly to the scene.\nImage courtesy Salvamento Maritimo\nTwo of the crewmembers from Bahía la Isleta survived the capsizing and self-rescued by swimming to safety on shore. However, the captain was trapped inside and went down with the ship.\nThe Guardia Civil's responders proceeded on the assumption that he could still be alive in an air pocket inside, and the dive team went down to inspect the wreck. The skipper had not survived; they recovered his body from within the boat and returned to the surface.\nAfter the search and recovery mission, the work turned to salvage. The boat was largely submerged in about 100 feet of water and posed a risk of pollution. The maritime captaincy of Almeria ordered it refloated and removed, and a salvage vessel belonging to Salvamento Maritimo took on the task.\nOn Saturday, Salvamento Maritimo's special operations group and the pollution-response vessel Clara Campoamor carried out the wreck removal using inflatable float bags. The recovery of the sunken vessel eliminates the possibility of further pollution and brings the salvage operation to a close.\nNuestro centro en #Almería coordinó ayer la operación de reflotamiento/izada/traslado de los restos del pesquero Bahía de lsleta.\nEn la complicada operación que acabó por la noche intervinieron el Grupo de Operaciones Especiales, el buque Clara Campoamor y la salvamar Algenib. pic.twitter.com/Obph6PITiA\n— SALVAMENTO MARÍTIMO (@salvamentogob) November 13, 2022\nSalvamar Algenib, con personal de operaciones especiales, realizando operaciones para mantener la flotabilidad del pesquero #BahialaIsleta, que volcó por un golpe de mar cuando faenaba a una milla de la costa de #LasNegras. pic.twitter.com/oyUhxdLcVh\n— SALVAMENTO MARÍTIMO (@salvamentogob) November 11, 2022\nMORE TOP STORIES\nItalian Coast Guard Responds to Two Groundings in Two Days\nBulker Operator Claims Proof That Subsea Cable Damage Was Accidental\nSean Duffy Confirmed as U.S. Secretary of Transportation\nContainership Schedule Reliability Stabilized Absorbing Red Sea Diversions\nEDITORIALS TOP STORIES\nIs Russia Helping China Build a Hybrid-Nuclear Submarine?\nWhy Shared Governance Could Save Our Oceans\nBeijing Struggles to Control Provinces as They Expand Distant-Water Fleet\nOp-Ed: Tide is Turning on Maritime Corruption, But We Must Finish the Job\nAn IMO Commitment to Polar Fuels Could Cut Black Carbon Emissions\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nPrint\nDigital\nNewsletter\nRenew\nSubscribe Now\nRELATED STORIES\nShipping\nSpanish Police Bust Smugglers Shipping Cocaine in Industrial Machines\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025 4:11 PM        \t\tby\nThe Maritime Executive\nSpain’s Policía Nacional working in coordination with the Tax Authority reports it has conducted a series of arrests breaking up a gang smuggling cocaine hidden in industrial machinery from South America aboard ships arriving at Spanish ports.

In 2021, 14 people were killed or injured by bears in Hokkaido, according to official reports.\nREAD MORE\n'I saw his leg in bear’s mouth': Wheelchair-bound granddad saves boy, 10, from 250lb black bear attack\nTO KILL OR NOT TO KILL: Debate over killer bear rages on as victim's family against putting it down\nWhat happened to Toshihiro Nishikawa?\nAccording to authorities, Toshihiro Nishikawa, 54, went missing while fishing alone on Sunday, May 14, near Lake Shumarinai in the town of Horokanai. The boat operator who took the man to his destination reportedly saw a bear with fishing boots hanging from its jaws that day. The driver then made unsuccessful phone calls to Toshihiro, according to Kyodo News. Horokanai authorities subsequently initiated a bear hunt, which culminated in the shooting of an animal in the region later that evening. During the hunt, a human head was also uncovered near where the fisherman was last seen. Local authorities, however, have yet to establish whether the head belongs to Toshihiro, an Okoppe native.

They reside in the Ussuri area of the Amur Region, Sakhalin Island, Hokkaido, and Kunashir Islands, as well as in northwest China and on the Korean peninsula. According to a report by public broadcaster NHK, the number of bear sightings in Hokkaido this year has increased, with the police receiving 339 complaints as of May 11—40 more than they did during the same time frame last year when bears were observed a record 2,240 times.\nPOPULAR ON MEAWW\nMORE ON MEAWW",

His unfortunate demise marks the first such incident for an Indian fisherman in a Pakistani jail this year. His mortal remains are set to be repatriated to India on April 29, while 35 Indian fishermen are expected to be released from Pakistani custody on April 30.   3 foreign-made revolvers, 120 9mm bullets & more: What CBI recovered in Bengal's Sandeshkhali raid   Koal, hailing from Goratpada hamlet in Dahanu taluka of Palghar district, worked on a fishing boat registered in Gujarat. He was arrested by the Pakistani Coast Guard in October 2022 for allegedly trespassing into Pakistani territorial waters. Tragically, Koal suffered a paralytic attack and collapsed while bathing on March 8. He was receiving medical treatment in a hospital within the Pakistani prison premises when he succumbed to his condition. The news of Koal's demise was informed to other Indian prisoners on March 17, who, with the help of unofficial channels, conveyed the message to Koal's family members in Goratpada. Concerned about the fate of Koal's remains, his family sought assistance from local MLA, who took up the matter with the central government. Subsequently, Indian authorities liaised with their Pakistani counterparts, resulting in an agreement to repatriate Koal's body to India. Jatin Desai, a representative of a social organization aiding prisoners in Pakistan, confirmed that Koal's body is scheduled to be handed over to Indian officials on April 29, likely in Amritsar, before being transported to Dahanu.

Koal is survived by his wife, three daughters, and two sons. Desai highlighted that despite discrepancies in his Aadhaar card, which stated Koal's age as 57, his family asserts that he was 45 years old at the time of his demise. Moreover, out of about 300 fishermen jailed in Pakistan, 35 individuals, including five from Dahanu in Palghar district, are slated for release and handover to Indian officials on April 30. These fishermen are expected to reunite with their families in the first week of May.MENAFN27042024007385015968ID1108145647\nLegal Disclaimer: MENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

But before officials could recover the cadaver, it was devoured by sharks.\nThe body, which was in a state of decomposition and missing its legs, was first spotted by fishermen, who reported the finding to the Yucalpetén naval base. The navy informed the state Ministry of Public Security, which dispatched a team to recover the body.\nHowever, before the team could do so, sharks attacked it and pulled it under the water, which SSP officials recorded on video. They were able to recover some body parts, giving them hints to the man’s identity.\nFrom what officials could see, the body was that of a bearded man with tattoos. Though no fishermen have been reported missing in the area, the body was presumed to belong to a fisherman who fell overboard three days ago, according to rumor.\nWith reports from La Verdad Noticias, El Universal\nMexico finds alleged cartel encampment on island by Texas border\nMND Staff -  January 29, 2025 0\nThe encampment appears to be the site from where alleged Mexican cartel members shot at Texas CPB agents on patrol Tuesday.\nWhite House: Trump ‘committed’ to leveraging 25% tariffs on Mexico, Canada\nMND Staff -  January 28, 2025 3\nPresident Sheinbaum said Monday that Mexico will seek dialogue with the Trump administration on the threatened tariff.\nTucson Samaritans: The volunteer group helping vulnerable migrants at the US-Mexico border\nMND Staff -  January 28, 2025 0\nThe group, founded in 2002, takes up to 14 trips into the Sonoran Desert each week to bring water, food, first aid and other essential items to migrants in need.\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinInstagram\nMexico's English-language newspaper\nAbout Us\nADVERTISE WITH MND\nSUBMISSIONS\nCOMMUNITY GUIDELINES\nSubscription FAQ's\nJobs\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinInstagram\nMexico News Daily - Property of Tavana LLC",

I am not sure of the details yet,” Sai Sai said.\nMeanwhile, Zambezi police spokesperson Kisco Sitali confirmed the incident yesterday, saying the body was found floating in water at Nkasa park.\n“The body was found in a decomposing state. No other visible injuries.\nThe drowning took place on Sunday [7 April 2024] at around 12h00. It was retrieved on 9 April 2024,” him confirmed.\nAccording to Sitali, the crime scene was attended by relevant officers, and the body was transported to Katima Mulilo. The autopsy is pending in the matter.\nThe next of kin have been informed, and police investigations continue.\nIt is alleged that the fishermen were fishing in the park, and the anti-poaching unit members from Namibia parks and wildlife found them fishing. They then tried to flee from the scene, prompting officials to fire warning shots.\nAfter encountering the anti-poaching unit, two of them were facing the direction from which the anti-poaching unit came, while their friend was facing the opposite direction.\nMudabeti said the two who were facing the anti-poaching unit jumped into the water while their friend on the other side, who did not see the anti-poaching unit coming, did not jump into the water. He surrendered with his hands in the air when the anti-poaching unit members pointed firearms at him.\nThe one who surrendered was warned that if he ran, he would be shot. He was thus instructed to walk towards the anti-poaching unit, which he complied with.\nOf the two who jumped into the water, one came out with his hands on his head, assuming a position of surrender, while being called to come towards the anti-poaching unit and was warned that if he ran, he would be shot, and he fully complied.\n“The first to surrender, who did not jump into the water, said to the anti-poaching unit that his other friend had not come out of the water, was still in the water, and informed them to retrieve his body, which they refused. The water was shallow, and the two survivors suggested that they use their fishing net to get their missing friend, but the anti-poaching unit refused to listen to the two survivors,” the movement alleges.\nMudabeti said after the survivors walked some metres under arrest, one of them checked behind, and he saw an object that resembled protruding parts of a human head and back floating in the water.\nHe apparently asked the anti-poaching unit to get to the object that he suspected was his friend.\nOne of the anti-poaching unit members said he also saw something that looked like a body, but his fellow officer refused to entertain even when his colleague insisted that he saw a person in the water.\n“Another officer asked the one who discharged his firearm if he indeed shot in the air because he saw something like a person too. The officer who shot maintained that he indeed shot in the air, and thus there was no need to search for the body of the missing person. A disagreement ensued between the anti-poaching officers as to whether to go back to the scene and search for the missing, or proceed with the two survivors,” he maintained. When the officers arrived at the camp, they left one of the survivors with one game ranger, and took the one who said he saw his friend so that he goes to search for his friend in the water.\nUpon arriving at the scene, the officers allegedly instructed the survivor to go into the water and search for his friend.\n“The survivor was very scared. He thought that they would shoot him too, and thus went into the water and searched for his missing friend in another direction because he feared that if he found him, the officers might shoot him too and accuse him of having attempted to run. The anti-poaching unit members then went back to the camp where they left the other survivor, and took both suspects to the Sangwali police station, charged them for illegal fishing and sent them home,” Mudabeti alleged.\nThe Namibian Lives Matter Movement is of the view that the anti-poaching unit was concerned about fining N$3 000 each of the survivors to instead of worrying about searching for the missing person, which shows how heartless they are.\nThe suspects then went home, and informed their elders of what transpired.\nThe elders went to the Sangwali police station to request the police to accompany them to the scene and retrieve the body of their missing relative, but the police allegedly refused to go with them.\nThe next morning, the police went to the scene with members of the community, and found the body of Samupwa.\nThe body was found in shallow water, which Mudabeti said rules out the possibility of drowning.\nThe body was taken to the police station.\nThe family was allegedly denied access to view the body until they almost became violent, which is when the police allowed a few members of the family to just view the face of the deceased, and not the whole body.\nThe stance of the movement is thus informed by these witness accounts as narrated and recorded by their regional leadership based in the Zambezi region, who were dispatched to the scene on 12 April 2024.\nThey also said the conduct of the anti-poaching unit also shows that they are very unprofessional. The movement is demanding the suspension of the commander of the patrol team of the anti-poaching unit who allowed his officers to open fire at an innocent and unarmed Namibian.\n“We demand the suspension of the Zambezi regional control warden for covering up this matter without alerting the police on time, who are constitutionally mandated to investigate cases of any crime. We demand the suspension of the shift commander at Sangwali police station who did not take the necessary action to accompany the family to the scene and retrieve the body of Lubinda Samupwa,” the movement petitioned.\nThey also request the inspector general of the Namibian Police to constitute an independent team of forensic investigation experts from the serious crime unit to be dispatched to the Zambezi region to carry out an independent, fair and impartial investigation on the death of Samupwa.\nPrevious PostKauandenge launches Nudo presidential bidNext PostCo-Creation hub grows startups\nRecent Posts\nNamibia’s unemployment rate hits 36.9%\nOmufekelwa momunyeka wokawe ta kala mokakuma\nEepelesenda 91 domaumbo momikunda odi na eepomba\nIikako itatu yosikola omumvo tagu ya\nOvafita vahamano vaElcin va kufwa moilonga …shaashi va ka konga oilonga komandiki eedolongo\nAbout Us\nVacancies\nProcurement\nGallery\nContact Us\nArchives\nArchives\nSelect Month  January 2025  (518)\nDecember 2024  (501)\nNovember 2024  (719)\nOctober 2024  (827)\nSeptember 2024  (733)\nAugust 2024  (683)\nJuly 2024  (783)\nJune 2024  (1262)\nMay 2024  (765)\nApril 2024  (572)\nMarch 2024  (623)\nFebruary 2024  (142)\nJanuary 2024  (426)\nDecember 2023  (510)\nNovember 2023  (773)\nOctober 2023  (754)\nSeptember 2023  (749)\nAugust 2023  (817)\nJuly 2023  (772)\nJune 2023  (706)\nMay 2023  (481)\nApril 2023  (466)\nMarch 2023  (611)\nFebruary 2023  (586)\nJanuary 2023  (488)\nDecember 2022  (344)\nNovember 2022  (624)\nOctober 2022  (687)\nSeptember 2022  (760)\nAugust 2022  (692)\nJuly 2022  (713)\nJune 2022  (697)\nMay 2022  (47)\nApril 2022  (364)\nMarch 2022  (740)\nFebruary 2022  (620)\nJanuary 2022  (243)\nMay 2021  (1)\nJanuary 2021  (1)\nDecember 2020  (4)\nNovember 2020  (493)\nOctober 2020  (708)\nSeptember 2020  (676)\nAugust 2020  (229)\nJuly 2020  (238)\nJune 2020  (658)\nMay 2020  (417)\nApril 2020  (533)\nMarch 2020  (705)\nFebruary 2020  (621)\nJanuary 2020  (406)\nDecember 2019  (286)\nNovember 2019  (611)\nOctober 2019  (661)\nSeptember 2019  (537)\nAugust 2019  (599)\nJuly 2019  (707)\nJune 2019  (567)\nMay 2019  (621)\nApril 2019  (635)\nMarch 2019  (570)\nFebruary 2019  (569)\nJanuary 2019  (421)\nDecember 2018  (400)\nNovember 2018  (709)\nOctober 2018  (677)\nSeptember 2018  (569)\nAugust 2018  (468)\nJuly 2018  (276)\nJune 2018  (614)\nMay 2018  (553)\nApril 2018  (608)\nMarch 2018  (633)\nFebruary 2018  (620)\nJanuary 2018  (519)\nDecember 2017  (391)\nNovember 2017  (601)\nOctober 2017  (637)\nSeptember 2017  (617)\nAugust 2017  (625)\nJuly 2017  (649)\nJune 2017  (667)\nMay 2017  (633)\nApril 2017  (490)\nMarch 2017  (533)\nFebruary 2017  (497)\nJanuary 2017  (424)\nDecember 2016  (307)\nNovember 2016  (282)\nOctober 2016  (513)\nSeptember 2016  (575)\nAugust 2016  (566)\nJuly 2016  (570)\nJune 2016  (587)\nMay 2016  (519)\nApril 2016  (599)\nMarch 2016  (522)\nFebruary 2016  (557)\nJanuary 2016  (396)\nDecember 2015  (366)\nNovember 2015  (691)\nOctober 2015  (715)\nSeptember 2015  (656)\nAugust 2015  (628)\nJuly 2015  (743)\nJune 2015  (716)\nMay 2015  (544)\nApril 2015  (645)\nMarch 2015  (596)\nFebruary 2015  (553)\nJanuary 2015  (300)\nDecember 2014  (396)\nNovember 2014  (632)\nOctober 2014  (703)\nSeptember 2014  (594)\nAugust 2014  (558)\nJuly 2014  (574)\nJune 2014  (520)\nMay 2014  (526)\nApril 2014  (550)\nMarch 2014  (564)\nFebruary 2014  (539)\nJanuary 2014  (406)\nDecember 2013  (332)\nNovember 2013  (499)\nOctober 2013  (617)\nSeptember 2013  (561)\nAugust 2013  (235)\nJuly 2013  (20)\nJune 2013  (9)\nMay 2013  (8)\nApril 2013  (5)\nMarch 2013  (5)\nFebruary 2013  (1)\nJanuary 2013  (1)\nDecember 2012  (1)\nNovember 2012  (1)\nFebruary 2012  (1)\nJuly 2008  (369)\nJune 2008  (433)\nMay 2008  (434)\nApril 2008  (431)\nMarch 2008  (336)\nFebruary 2008  (416)\nJanuary 2008  (359)\nDecember 2007  (332)\nNovember 2007  (451)\nOctober 2007  (407)\nSeptember 2007  (351)\nAugust 2007  (354)\nJuly 2007  (373)\nJune 2007  (337)\nMay 2007  (291)\nApril 2007  (308)\nMarch 2007  (339)\nFebruary 2007  (287)\nJanuary 2007  (235)\nDecember 2006  (232)\nNovember 2006  (295)\nOctober 2006  (324)\nSeptember 2006  (347)\nAugust 2006  (339)\nJuly 2006  (325)\nJune 2006  (351)\nMay 2006  (277)\nApril 2006  (301)\nMarch 2006  (374)\nFebruary 2006  (346)\nJanuary 2006  (207)\nDecember 2005  (281)\nNew Era Namibia © 2024 All Rights Reserved\nNews\nNational\nCourts & Crime\nOpinions\nAgriculture\nBusiness\nInternational\nLanguages\nEenguhudana\nKhoekhoegowab\nRukwangali\nOtjiherero\nSilozi\nOmaudhano\nEenghundana Domalihafifo\nLifestyle\nMotoring\nSports\nYouth\nFocus\nArticles\nDownloads\nFeatured\nPhoto of The Week\nGallery\nPodcasts\nePaper\nElections\nClose\nPlease Enable JavaScript in your Browser to Visit this Site.",

We should have some direct link to the senior members of national security. Wardens could report illegality, risks, hotspots, and smuggling areas.\"\nHe said piracy is growing, and the Gulf of Paria is a hotspot. For that reason, stakeholders should increase their presence compared to other areas.\n\"That committee could dictate and direct the use of resources, the concerns of threats on the sea and could have a direct mechanism for reporting the reports of the honorary security wardens,\" Aboud said.\n\"We have advised that our fishermen should arm themselves, I am told to say legally armed. A spear gun is a legal weapon. \"\nHe believes fishermen need to be prepared and ready to flee any vessel approaching within 300 metres, and coming within such proximity should be considered an act of violation.\nHe made several allegations against the Prime Minister, government ministers, and the Venezuelan military, saying he had proof to back his claims.\nInvestigations are ongoing.\nTrending\nview all\n1\nWI players can't bat to save their lives\nNewsday\n2\n$300,000 bail for suspended cop accused of rape\nJada Loutoo\n3\nMan freed of murder after 21 years: Justice system ‘hell and failure'\nJada Loutoo\n4\nMove faster on African snails\nNewsday\nComments\n\"Claxton Bay fisherman dead in attack at sea\"\nMore in this section\nNews\nNPTA: Parents need to be more involved in their children's education\nClint Chan Tack\nNews\nDetention orders issued for Diego Martin, Belmont men\nJada Loutoo\nNews\nFormer Carib executive launches business support company\nRyan Hamilton-Davis\nNews\nNew bmobile tech lets users talk, surf web simultaneously\nRyan Hamilton-Davis\n© 2020 - 2025 Trinidad and Tobago Newsday.\nNewsday on Facebook\nNewsday on Instagram\nNewsday on Twitter\nNewsday on YouTube\nNewsday on LinkedIn\nAbout Us\nClassifieds\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us",

The fishermen’s leader said that earlier it was easy for the fishermen to swim back to safety when boats capsized, but after the construction commenced at Vizhinjam it is difficult to reach the shore safely.\nThe sand deposits in the Muthalapozhi are also another reason for the boats overturning in the area while entering the sea.\nA Marine coastal police officer while speaking to IANS said that the search was on for the missing fishermen and the local people were also involved in the search operations.\n–IANS\nShare\nFacebookTwitterGoogle+WhatsAppEmailPinterestFacebook MessengerLinkedin\nNewsroom Odisha Network\nPrev Post\nPM Modi praises Chhattisgarh’s Godhan Nyay Yojana\nNext Post\nFiring at Kolkata museum: CISF jawan remanded to 14-day police custody\nYou might also like\nMore from author\nIndia\nHuge influx of devotees in Ayodhya on Mauni Amavasya; over 50 lakh pilgrims visit…\nIndia\nRG Kar protest: SC passes protection order for doctors who returned to work after…\nIndia\nCalcutta HC seeks report on ‘threat culture’ at RG Kar Hospital\nIndia\nMaha Kumbh stampede: Four from Karnataka confirmed dead\nPrev\nNext\nComments are closed.\nFacebook  Join us on Facebook      Twitter  Join us on Twitter      Youtube  Join us on Youtube\nHome\nAbout US\nଓଡ଼ିଆ ରେ ପଢନ୍ତୁ\nContact us\nDisclaimer\n© 2025 - All Rights Reserved.\nSign in\nWelcome, Login to your account.\nForget password?\nRemember me\nSign in\nRecover your password.\nA password will be e-mailed to you.",

Families and friends of the nine crew members are concerned because none of them have been located.\nThe boat’s owner, Kwame Tawiah, told the reporters that the crew had left the Ngyirasia fishing harbor for the Half Assini region but hadn’t come back. He continued by saying they had contacted the police for help and were hopeful the team would show up shortly.\nMr. Tawiah further disclosed that on the morning of July 7, the crew that went missing made a quick phone contact to him to say they were all still alive but the boat was out of fuel.

While Mandal owned the boat, Mallick was a worker.\nAccording to sources, while they were fishing in the boat, around 12:00 noon, some bullet-like object hit both when they trespassed into the no-entry zone. It is feared that the firing of artillery shells hit them.\nThe fishermen were brought to Balasore District Headquarters Hospital in critical condition. However, the doctor declared Kamalakant brought dead. Besides, the critically injured Padmalochan is undergoing treatment.\nIf sources are to be believed, bruises were noticed on the bodies of the deceased and the injured.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that artillery testing is often conducted from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur off the Odisha coast by the Defence Department. Many nearby areas have been restricted by the Defense Department for safety measures.\nIt is suspected that the fisherman might have sustained injuries while fishing in the no-entry zone when artillery testing was underway. On the other hand, it is also suspected that someone may have shot the fishermen due to past enmity over a territorial dispute.\nHowever, it is yet to be ascertained whether any artillery testing was conducted by the Defence Department today or not. A proper investigation into the incident can unravel the actual reason that led to the incident.\nTags: Balasore newsChandipur ITRFisherman DeadRestricted Zone Of Chandipur\nRelated Posts\nBreaking\nAgni-4 Ballistic Missile Successfully Launched from Odisha’s Chandipur ITR\n06-Sep-2024\nBreaking\nDRDO Successfully Conducts 4 Flight Trials Of High-Speed Expendable Aerial Target ‘Abhyas’ Off Odisha Coast\n05-Feb-2024\nBreaking\nYouth Critically Injured In Attack Over Illegal Liquor Trade\n10-Sep-2023\nBreaking\nSimulia CHC Senior Clerk Lands In Vigilance Net After Caught Taking Rs 8K Bribe\n14-Aug-2023\nBreaking\nQuestion Papers of JE Civil Main Written Exam Were Leaked: Balasore SP\n23-Jul-2023\nBreaking\nChandipur IIC, ASI Caught Taking Rs 50K Bribe From Liquor Trader In Balasore\n19-Jul-2023\nTrending Now\nMICE and Wedding Tourism: Odisha’s New Growth Catalysts Highlighted at Utkarsh Odisha\nOdisha Solidifies Position as Global Investment Hub: CM Mohan Majhi\nOdisha Govt’s Key Initiative to Ensure Flawless Motor Vehicle Fitness Testing\nMahakumbh 2025: Crores of devotees take holy dip at Triveni Sangam on Mauni Amavasya\nTata Steel SEZ ascertains contribution to Odisha’s growth journey\nNews Calendar\nJanuary 2025\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n12345\n6789101112\n13141516171819\n20212223242526\n2728293031\n« Dec\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nHome2024\nPrivacy Policy\n© 2025 Pragativadi\nNo Result\nView All Result\nEpaper\nOdisha\nTwin City\nBhubaneswar\nCuttack\nNation\nWorld\nSports\nEntertainment\nMovies\nOTT\nScience & Tech\nLifestyle\nEducation\nCulture\nTourism\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\n© 2025 Pragativadi\ntoto slot login\nwebsite bakautoto\nsitus togel bakautoto\ntoto slot\nBAKAUTOTO\nslot toto\nbo togel\nbakautoto\nbakautoto\nlive draw hk\nbakautoto\npafipcindonesia.org\nhttps://pafipclahat.org/\nhttps://bakautotoslot.id\nhttps://custom900.com/\nhttps://belsorriso.ro/\nsitus togel\nsitus toto\nhttps://smpitbinailmu.sch.id/-/\ntoto slot\nhttps://inspiracionspa.com.mx/-/\nhttps://bakautoto.id/\nsydneylotto\nslot bet 200 perak\nsitus toto\nbet togel\nhttps://akfarcefada.ac.id/\nhttps://givingbackup.umcced.edu.my/\nhttps://email.umbogorraya.ac.id/\nhttps://mtsn3cianjur.com/\nhttps://buycbd.net/\nhttps://www.schinfo.kumiuniversity.ac.ug/\nsitus toto\nhttps://reciamuc.com/public/\nhttps://cyberlibrary.unsia.ac.id/\nsitus toto\nidn slot\nhttps://www.folhadepiedade.com.br/\nslot gacor\nsitus toto slot\nhttps://majalahrm.id/\nslot gacor hari ini\nsitus toto\nhttps://www.newbiekitchen.com/\nsitus toto slot\ntoto macau\ntoto slot\ntoto slot\ntoto slot\nhttps://fathers.com/wp-content/uploads/\ntoto slot\nhttps://dpmptsp.pasamanbaratkab.go.id/\nhttps://eras4olt.org/\ntoto slot\nbo togel\nsitus toto slot\ntoto slot\ntoto macau\nhttps://myih.id/\nmonperatoto\ntoto slot\ntoto slot\nbo togel\nhttps://hris.pgn-perkasa.co.id/pchat/web/\ntoto slot\nsitus slot gacor\ntoto slot\nidn slot\nbot spaceman\nslot bet 400\nbakautoto\ntoto hongkong pools\ntoto hk\nbo togel",

In this sense, the Secretary of the Navy (SEMAR) is reinforcing actions by sea.”\nState Civil Protection (Coordinación Estatal de Protección Civil QRoo) also posted information regarding the ongoing search.\n“The search for fishermen in Chiquilá intensifies. Civil Protection of Quintana Roo reports that the search and rescue work for lost fishermen in the community of Chiquilá is intensifying in coordination with SEMAR, the SSC and Municipal Civil Protection.\n“In addition to the aircraft used to search for them by sky, nine vessels with 33 elements from different state authorities join the operation and all the necessary technology is used to locate the fishermen on the high seas.”\nThe two lost Holbox fishermen left the Port of Chiquila February 9 aboard vessel Ruth Selene in search of sawfish with a scheduled return date for February 11.

Four fishermen were in the vessel and two were rescued, according to the National Sea Rescue Institute. The deceased man’s body has been sent to the police’s forensic pathology services. Police and lifeguards are continuing the search for the missing man.\nGreytown – The former mayor of Umvoti (Greytown) local municipality, Thami Ngubane from the ANC, has weighed in on the political and administrative issues in the municipality. Ngubane says the power struggle over who is the rightful municipal manager between Noxolo Ndaba and acting municipal manager Martin Manslow should not be an issue as the provincial Cooperative Governance department had ruled that Manslow’s appointment as chief financial officer was irregular in the first place.\nVerulam—Reaction Unit South Africa, a private security company based in Verulam, north of Durban, has been called in to try to locate a container containing a stock of toothpaste that was stolen on 1 June at Terrance Park. The truck was later recovered but the container was missing. The hijacking of trucks with valuable goods has become common in the Durban area in the past few months.\nHowick – Howick Falls, one of the prominent tourist attractions in the KZN Midlands, is undergoing maintenance. According to the DA-run Umngeni local municipality, the planned maintenance will take place throughout the remainder of this year, and some sections of the falls that attract international visitors will be periodically closed. It added that the maintenance was being undertaken to enhance the beauty of the falls for future generations.\nMargate – The KZN Sharks Board says it has removed all shark safety nets and temporarily banned public bathing from Port Edward to Isipingo in the south of Durban. It said on Tuesday, it would remove the Sharks Board’s safety gear from Anstey’s and Brighton beaches, and bathing at these beaches will also be banned. This has been done to allow a seamless annual sardine run along the south coast of the province.\nPictured above: Umgababa beach.\nSource: SAVenues\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp\nRecent articles\nDA not leaving the Government of National Unity\nTrump pulls the plug on HIV aid in Mzansi\nFilthy conditions force morgue to close its doors\nKwaZulu-Natal man arrested for possession of police firearms\n#RealNewsForMobile\n© Copyright Scrolla.Africa\nMORE STORIES\nTrump pulls the plug on HIV aid in Mzansi\n29th January 2025\nFilthy conditions force morgue to close its doors\n28th January 2025\nKwaZulu-Natal man arrested for possession of police firearms\n28th January 2025",

Two People Die\nIt follows authorities’ decision to block fishermen from Jangwani village of Mto wa Mbu from fishing in Lake Manyara, a protected area.\nThe Chanzo Reporter\nMay 25, 2023\nsubscribe to our newsletter!\nName\nEmail\nSubscribe Now!\nDar es Salaam. Authorities in Tanzania’s northern region of Arusha will spend some sleepless nights in the coming few days trying to repair the damaged relations between villagers of the region’s Mto wa Mbu area and rangers whose latest face-off left two people dead, with two others feared drowned in the region’s Lake Manyara.\nReports of the clashes started to emerge on May 22, 2023, when rangers from the Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA), the agency tasked with managing the country’s national parks, blocked fishermen from Jangwani village of Mto wa Mbu from fishing in a section of Lake Manyara\nVillagers told journalists that rangers knocked several fishermen’s boats, causing them to capsize, leaving the fishermen floating helplessly on the water, trying to save themselves from drowning.\n“The rangers started to knock our boats out with their motor-powered boat,” a fisherman from the Jangwani village, Samson Nyakisi, recounted. “There were about 36 people who were left floating on water.”\nREAD MORE: Ngorongoro: A Blot on Samia’s Human Rights Record?\nAfter the fishermen noticed two of their colleagues were missing, they returned to the village to report the incident to their fellow villagers, who subsequently organised demonstrations, blocking the main road connecting Mto wa Mbu and Karatu, one of Arusha’s seven districts.\nThe villagers protested the alleged drowning of their two fellow villagers at the village government offices, leading police officers to open fire on the protesting villagers, leaving two villagers dead, one on the spot and another while receiving treatment at the Mount Meru Hospital.\nPolice claim that the villagers were “causing destructions and tried to enter TANAPA offices,” a claim villagers refute.\nReports indicate that police opened fire in the presence of the area’s ward councillor and the Monduli district commissioner, Mr Joshua Nassari, who arrived at the scene intending to calm the situation and bring some order.\n“It was a challenge,” Mr Nassari, who took the villager’s body that police shot dead, described what he saw. “The misunderstanding between fishermen and conservators led to this demonstration which erupted into a big scuffle.”\nInvestigation underway\nOn May 23, 2023, Arusha regional police commander Justine Masejo said the region’s law enforcement agency would investigate the incident, pointing out that police are already holding twelve individuals in connection with the clashes.\nAddressing the incident on May 23, 2023, Minister for Tourism and Natural Resources Mohamed Mchengerwa applauded the rangers for their bravery in protecting Tanzania’s natural resources even at a time when doing so risked their lives.\n“Although our rangers were armed, they never used force in arresting these criminals and poachers,” Mr Mchengerwa told journalists. “Thanks to this, these criminals organise and attack our rangers and disappear with criminals already under arrest.”\nREAD MORE: Conservation: This is How Humans, Wild Animals Can Coexist In Tanzania\nBut fishermen from the village deny being involved in criminal activities, complaining instead of being on the receiving end of violence from park rangers. According to villagers, confusion exists on what constitutes a protected area and what does not.\nFor example, Richard Rogert, a fisherman and villager of the Jangwani area, told local media that they have been pleading with authorities for a long time to clear the confusion park rangers use to harass the villagers daily.\n“We carry out our fishing activities in a nonprotected zone, but [rangers] still come and knock our boats,” Rogert complained. “They do that while saying the area is a TANAPA protected zone but no beacons proving that can be seen.”\nBut TANAPA’s conservation commissioner William Mwakilema told reporters that beacons used to exist, but villagers themselves removed them.\nREAD MORE: LHRC Wants Existing Conservation Laws Scrapped Off Tanzania’s Law Book\n“The conserved areas include the Marang Forest, the Rift Valley corridors, and part of the Lake Manyara,” Mr Mwakilema noted while addressing the recent clash between his rangers and villagers. “The areas were identified and demarcated in collaboration with stakeholders, but some unruly residents have destroyed the beacons.”\nThis is not the first time that conservation authorities in Mto wa Mbu become at loggerheads with villagers in the area.\nOn November 17, 2018, three fishermen – Paulin Ngalabushi, Isack Nyingi, and Cornelius Karabona – who had camped at Lake Manyara were reported to have gone missing, never to be seen again, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that park rangers took them.\nMain drivers\nGeographically Mto wa Mbu sits right at the bottom of the Rift Valley. It connects two important national parks, Tarangire National Park and Lake Manyara National Park. Together, the two form the Tarangire Manyara Ecosystem.​​\nThe town lies along a vital transport route connecting Arusha and Mara regions through the Serengeti. It is on a flat terrain with wealthy soils and is drained by tributaries from the upper part of the Rift Valley.\nREAD MORE: Majaliwa Receives Indigenous Peoples’ Recommendations on Conservation\nDr Ronald Ndesanjo, a human ecologist from the University of Dar es Salaam, thinks these factors are the main drivers for Mto wa Mbu’s rapid urbanisation and expansion.\nHe told The Chanzo during an interview that more recently, the towns of Mto wa Mbu and Karatu have attracted enormous tourist investments, especially lodges, campsites and support infrastructures and other facilities.\n“Amidist all these dynamics is population growth and subsequent rise in demand for food and fresh produce to feed the town’s burgeoning population and nearby areas,” Dr Ndesanjo said. “This is coupled with rising demand for areas to settle the expanding population and influx of people.”\nThese dynamics have resulted in spillover effects on Lake Manyara National Park and the lake itself, Dr Ndesanjo thinks.\nThey include lake eutrophication from farming and other human activities in Mto wa Mbu and rapid expansion of farms into the lake’s wetlands and fringes, posing a threat to the lake’s existence.\n“The ecological impacts on the lake are slower and hardly attract violent response from conservation authorities,” Dr Ndesanjo told The Chanzo. “The villagers’ encroachment is likely to trigger an immediate and often violent response by park rangers. The latter aspect might have led to the recent incident.”\nStopping the violence\nAsked for his opinion on how best the government can improve the relations between conservation authorities and surrounding communities, Dr Ndesanjo said there is no shortcut to achieving that, laying out what he calls “long-term but important” initiatives to prevent violence from recurring.\n“The government should make long-term investments to create alternative livelihood opportunities to park neighbouring communities,” he suggested. “These could range from eco-tourism, community-based conservation in its truest sense and other secondary livelihood options.”\nDr Ndesanjo also called on the government to re-evaluate its population and conservation policies to bring about harmony between rapid population expansion and efforts to expand conservation areas and initiatives in the country.\n“Proceeds from tourism should be adequately shared with park neighbouring communities as opposed to being appropriated by central government and the political and business elite class,” he suggested.\n“This way, a common Tanzanian will see the true benefits of conservation and very likely support it,” the expert added.\nThe Chanzo is hosting Digital Freedom and Innovation Day on Saturday April 20, 2024 at Makumbusho ya Taifa.\nRegister to secure your spot\nThe Chanzo Reporter\nOne Response\nKathie knell says:\n29 December 2023 at 9:42 PM\nVery interesting I am doing some research on the conflict between ranges and local villages.

You were our captain, our friend.”\nOn 19 December 2023, a maritime tragedy unfolded in English waters when tragedy struck the 0-51 Stormvogel. While repairing nets after a tear, crew members Ilir Devick and Michael Hubert were on duty when a safety line unexpectedly snapped. This resulted in the part to which the nets were attached crashing down, proving fatal for Michael Hubert, a father of two daughters, who succumbed on the spot. His colleague Ilir Devick sustained serious injuries and is currently undergoing recovery in a rehabilitation centre.\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON RESQUNIT\nLead Story:\nTragedy Onboard Belgian-Registered Beam Trawler as Fisherman Dies\nThe incident prompted investigations from both English authorities and the Belgian Work Welfare Supervision Service. Skipper Dave Orban (37), visibly distressed upon their return, stated, “Before departure in Belgium, we had checked everything, as is standard procedure. Everything was in order. We don’t understand how this could have happened. We did everything we were supposed to do; no one could have prevented this.”\nDespite assertions that all safety protocols were followed, Dave, also a father of two daughters, grappled with a profound sense of responsibility for the accident. “As a skipper, you bear the responsibility for your men on board your ship. Of course, I feel guilty,” he confessed. This overwhelming guilt took a toll on Dave in the following weeks, culminating in an unbearable burden. On Monday evening last, 22 January, the skipper’s lifeless body was discovered; he had taken his own life.\n“Why, Dave? It was already tough enough. You were our captain, our friend,” lamented Ilir Devick on social media, capturing the crew’s deep emotional turmoil over the second loss within their team. Fellow crew members echoed sentiments, emphasising that Dave should not shoulder blame, underscoring the familial bond among them.\nThe owner of the 0-51 Stormvogel, VVC Equipment, expressed profound sorrow over the skipper’s death, stating, “This is not a colleague we lose but a brother. That goes for the entire crew. They are not just colleagues; they are family.” The owner emphasised the importance of collective processing of grief, highlighting the close-knit nature of life on board where crew members spend 24 hours a day together, sharing both joys and sorrows.\nHowever, collective coping became challenging due to the ongoing investigation. The ship remained docked, and the crew was prohibited from sailing or even boarding. The vessel was sealed, and extensive interrogations took an emotional toll on everyone. Dave, in particular, struggled with these interrogations. The crew contends that the relentless focus on assigning blame for the accident neglected the well-being of the crew. Instead of solely seeking a culprit, they argue that authorities should have supported the crew in their grieving process.\nThe labour prosecutor’s office is actively investigating the fatal accident involving Michael Hubert. “That is the normal procedure. If there was an error, it needs to be investigated whether someone can be held responsible. A technical expert has also been appointed to examine exactly what happened,” confirmed labour prosecutor Filiep De Ketelaere.\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

Speaking to Norwegian fishing magazine Fiskeribladet, Linda Hansen, the rescue leader at HRS Northern Norway, informed that its journalists that the centre received a distress signal via the Cospas-Sarsat system at 0900 on Tuesday morning, signalling that a fishing vessel was in the process of sinking.\n“It is an international system for picking up distress signals. Our job then is to ensure that the rescue centre responsible for the area where the alarm is triggered has received the alarm and that a rescue operation has been initiated,” Hansen told Fiskeribladet this afternoon.\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON RESQUNIT\nThe MRCC rescue station in Torshavn confirmed to Fiskeribladet that that the fishing vessel concerned in the incident was the longliner ‘Kambur’. The longliner had previously sailed under the Norwegian flag, first as ‘Geir’ when owned by the H.P. Holmeset shipping company. Later, it was sold to Austevoll and named ‘Østerfjord’. As previously reported by Fiskeribladet, ‘Østerfjord’ was sold to the Faroe Islands in 2021, where it has since operated under the name ‘Kambur’.\nThe vessel was just south of the Faroe Islands when it encountered difficulties. Fiskeribladet confirmed from the rescue station at 1345 (12.45pm GMT) that the boat in question has sunk. MRCC reported that the boat listed severely, leading to its sinking. There were 16 people on board, and 14 of them have been rescued. A search is currently underway for the two missing crew members.\nAccording to the newspaper KVF, the police report that the two missing individuals are in their 40s and 50s. The 14 rescued crew members have been sent to the hospital but are not believed to be seriously injured.\nA helicopter and four to five boats are involved in the search. According to MRCC, a reconnaissance plane from Denmark was planned to assist, but it has encountered technical problems. The weather is poor, with strong northeast winds in the area, as reported by MRCC to Fiskeribladet.\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

Image: MCIB Report\nThe Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) has released its investigation report into the tragic marine casualty which occurred on 28 September 2023, near Bruckless Pier in Donegal, when a recreational boater, operating alone, fell overboard and drowned.\nThe incident happened between 15:30 and 16:30 in challenging weather conditions, with wind gusts up to 35 knots. The boater, a man in his late sixties, was not wearing a lifejacket, and his vessel was found moored approximately 50 metres offshore.\nInvestigation Findings: The Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) conducted an investigation into the incident, revealing several factors that contributed to the tragedy:\nVessel Condition: The boat, an older model, lacked modern safety features such as a reboarding ladder, which became mandatory after 2013 under the EU Recreational Craft Directive.\nLack of Safety Equipment: The victim was not wearing a personal flotation device (PFD) and had no means of raising the alarm or reboarding the vessel from the water.\nCold Water Immersion: The water temperature was 14°C, and the victim likely succumbed to cold water shock and incapacitation, which led to his drowning.\nChallenging Weather: A Small Craft Warning was in effect, and the conditions were described as challenging, with strong winds and rain.\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON CATCHAM\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON RESQUNIT\nEmergency Response: The incident was reported by a member of the public, and a swift multi-agency response was coordinated by the Marine Rescue Sub-Centre at Malin Head. Despite the prompt actions of rescuers, who performed CPR on the victim after recovering him from the water, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.\nSafety Recommendations: In light of the investigation, the MCIB made several recommendations to improve safety and prevent similar incidents in the future. These include better adherence to safety guidelines, ensuring the availability and use of PFDs, and enhancing awareness of the risks associated with operating alone in adverse conditions.\nConclusion: This incident highlights the importance of safety precautions, particularly the use of lifejackets, proper voyage planning, and the need for adequate training in operating recreational craft. The MCIB urges boaters to take heed of these recommendations to avoid further tragedies on Irish waters.\nREAD THE MCIB INCIDENT REPORT IN FULL BY CLICKING HERE\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

Despite immediate efforts by the crew to rescue their colleague, the situation ended in tragedy.\nThe Kingfisher, an 18.35-metre fishing vessel, was operating in the North Sea when the incident took place. The crew quickly initiated a man overboard protocol, deploying life-saving equipment and issuing distress calls to nearby vessels and maritime authorities.\nThe UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) coordinated a swift response, dispatching search and rescue teams, including helicopters and lifeboats, to the location. Unfortunately, despite the comprehensive search efforts, the individual was recovered but pronounced deceased.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CATCHCAM\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON RESQUNIT\nReplying to a request on the incident, a Police Scotland spokesperson said:\n“Around 5.10pm on Friday, 12 July, 2024, we were made aware of a man having gone overboard from a fishing vessel in the North Sea, 30 miles east of Orkney.\n“Emergency services attended however the 42-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.\n“Enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident are ongoing and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.”\nAs investigations continue, the maritime industry is reminded of the critical importance of safety protocols and preparedness for such emergencies.

The skipper attempted to recover him from the water but also fell overboard. Neither of them were wearing personal flotation devices.\nBoth men were recovered by the inexperienced remaining crew member. The skipper was unresponsive and, despite efforts by the vessel’s crew and search and rescue personnel, he could not be revived. The MAIB says, their investigation found that control measures identified in the vessel’s operational risk assessments had not been implemented immediately after the net was taken on board after the fishing operation ended. This allowed, with the deteriorating weather conditions, for the net to slip overboard, which led to an emergency situation that continued to escalate with dire consequences.\nIn the report they say, “Given the existing extensive safety guidance to fishing vessel owners and skippers, specifically on mitigating the risks of falling overboard, and the requirement for fishermen to wear a personal flotation device or to have measures in place to prevent falling overboard, no recommendations are made in this report.”\nIn the Report analysis the MAIB finds that the skipper “died from immersion in water” after falling overboard while attempting to rescue the boat’s senior deckhand who have fallen overboard while trying to retrieve the trawl net.\nIt says, “He was not wearing a restraint arrangement, which would have prevented his fall overboard, nor a PFD, which would have increased his chance of survival once in the water. While the skipper and senior deckhand had extensive fishing experience at sea, the sequence of events that led to the falls overboard and subsequent rescue attempts resulted from poor work practices, infrequent emergency drills, and consequently a lack of familiarity with rescue techniques and equipment.”\nThe Report also points to the stowage and recovery of nets. It says:\n“The stowed nets protruded above the 700mm bulwark and made them vulnerable in adverse weather. Recovery of the nets during fishing was a daily operation for the crew and the nets’ stowage position was unchangeable. The situation changed when Reul a Chuain encountered unexpected bad weather that caused the vessel to roll heavily and an unlashed net to slip overboard. The net recovery operation then changed when the net hook became unusable, and the conditions made rerigging it impractical and risky. The decision to recover the net by hand may have been a logical solution, but it introduced additional 12 risks on the cluttered deck that the crew had not considered. The risk assessments found on board Reul a Chuain appeared to cover the risks associated with the vessel’s operation. Poor stowage of equipment was identified as a hazard and the listed control measure was for equipment to be stowed appropriately and lashed down. Despite this, the nets had not been lashed down at the end of fishing and before starting passage to port.”\nThe report also found that the senior deckhand placed himself in a vulnerable position by standing on top of the nets to pull them in. The report finds:\n“Furthermore, he was neither wearing a safety harness and lifeline to prevent a fall overboard nor a PFD. Once he had fallen overboard, he required assistance to reboard the vessel as there was no foothold. Having seen the senior deckhand fall overboard, the skipper’s action to reach down to help him in the water below was probably instinctive and without thought for his own safety or the consequences. The skipper’s position by the low bulwark, the vessel’s continued rolling and the additional force required to assist the senior deckhand likely caused him to overbalance and then fall overboard, leaving the inexperienced junior deckhand to cope on his own with two men in the water.”\nThe Report examined the survivability in cod water. It says:\n“Survivability in cold water It is likely that the skipper’s initial fall into the water, the effect of the waves and the induced stress and confusion, combined with his later incapacitation due to the lifebuoy around his knees, caused him to inhale water. Reported observations during the attempted resuscitation were consistent with water inhalation.\n“After his initial fall overboard, the skipper would have expended a significant amount of energy trying to remain afloat. Additionally, the cold water would have limited his capacity to operate within minutes of immersion, and cold water shock and hypothermic effects would have caused stress in his system.\n“MAIB statistics have consistently shown that survivability following a man overboard is more likely if a PFD or lifejacket is worn.”\nOn casualty recovery, it found:\n“The junior deckhand had not taken part in a practical man overboard drill on Reul a Chuain and consequently was unaware of the presence of any man overboard recovery equipment. Although the skipper had talked him through emergency scenarios during his time on board, his focus was on operating the fshing gear. The junior deckhand was unprepared to respond when faced with the situation of both his colleagues falling into the water in adverse weather. However, despite unfamiliarity with the operation of the winch, he managed to successfully follow the senior deckhand’s instructions to set it up and use it to recover both men. The junior deckhand subsequently applied his training to perform CPR on the skipper in an attempt to save his life.”\nThe Report also found regulatory oversight:\n“Regulatory oversight The MCA’s 5-yearly surveys and intermediate inspections of Reul a Chuain enabled surveyors to assess the vessel and issue it with a fishing vessel certificate for operation. However, surveyor’s inspections are carried out in port and are thereby limited to the presentation of the vessel, its equipment and paperwork on the day of the survey or inspection. Surveyors do not have oversight of a vessel’s day-to-day operations once it is at sea and cannot know if risk mitigation measures are regularly applied.\n“Reul a Chuain’s safety folder appeared to have been completed correctly; however, risk assessments had not been updated for some time and several risk mitigation measures were not routinely applied by the crew once the vessel was at sea.\n“The permitted low bulwark heights of Reul a Chuain meant that there was an increased risk of falling overboard. There was no requirement to ft safety rails or guard wires as this would have interfered with the operation of the vessel. The alternative was the provision of restraint arrangements where there was a risk of falling overboard. However, the crew did not wear restraint arrangements, and not all the crew routinely wore PFDs when working on deck.”\nThe MAIB Report reaches the conclusions:\nThe net falling over the stern was an emergency situation. The crew became task focused to bring it back on board and did not take a moment to step back and reassess the risks to either themselves or each other.\nThe volume of the trawl nets at the stern resulted in them being above the height of the bulwark in the stowage area; they were not secured, and partially fell overboard when Reul a Chuain rolled in heavy weather. The subsequent net recovery was hampered by the failure of the net hook, which prompted the senior deckhand to put himself in danger to try and help recover the net by hand.\nThe net retrieval operation changed when the hook slipped out, and the process was not fully reassessed for risks. Consequently, when the senior deckhand climbed onto the net he was neither wearing a restraint arrangement nor one of the PFDs that were on board. The senior deckhand fell overboard because he was standing on the net, attempting to bring it back on board, when it slipped overside as the vessel rolled heavily.\nThe skipper fell overboard because he leant over the side while attempting to help the senior deckhand back on board. The vessel was rolling heavily and he was not wearing a fall prevention harness.\nLachlan Robertson died from the effects of immersion in water. His chances of survival would have been improved had he worn his PFD.\nReul a Chuain’s crew had not practised man overboard recovery and were unfamiliar with the vessel’s man overboard recovery equipment. Therefore, the reaction to the senior deckhand going overboard was ineffective.\nReul A Chuain’s low bulwark increased the risk of falling overboard but the vessel had been granted an exemption from the regulations due to its age, type of operations and the mandatory provision of restraint arrangements for the crew. The vessel’s risk assessments recognised this hazard and identifed the use of restraint arrangements and PFDs as mitigation measures.\nThe mitigation measures identified in Reul a Chuain’s risk assessment concerning falling overboard were not routinely implemented on the vessel. Restraint arrangements were not found on board Reul a Chuain by the MAIB during its post-accident investigation.\nThe junior deckhand managed to recover both men, transmit a distress call to the coastguard, perform CPR, and assist search and rescue personnel. These actions were commendable given his limited experience\nRead the MAIB report in full here\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

An MCIB investigation into a fatal accident onboard the boat found safety lapses\nA marine investigation has revealed critical safety failures following a tragic incident on February 4, 2023, involving the fishing vessel Séimi near Arranmore Island.\nThe Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) report, released on August 22, 2024, details how a crew member lost his life after being dragged overboard during routine operations.\nThe vessel was engaged in shooting crab pots when the crew member on deck became entangled in the line of the last pot, leading to his swift descent into the cold Atlantic waters. Despite the crew’s immediate response, which included halting the vessel and retrieving the man within 15 minutes, the crew member, who was not wearing a Personal Flotation Device (PFD), could not be resuscitated.\nThe MCIB report highlights several safety shortcomings aboard the Séimi, including the failure to enforce the use of PFDs and the lack of sufficient safety training among the crew. The report notes that while the vessel was compliant with the Code of Practice for vessels under 15 metres, these gaps in safety practices contributed to the fatal outcome.\nThe FV Séimi at Ballyglass pier. Image: MCIB Report\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON CATCHAM\nCLICK HERE SEE MORE INFORMATION ON RESQUNIT\nThe incident underscores the importance of stringent safety protocols and adequate training in the fishing industry, particularly for small vessels operating in challenging conditions. The MCIB has issued recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies in the future, urging vessel owners to enforce safety regulations more rigorously and ensure that all crew members are adequately trained and equipped.\nAnalysis Summary\nUnsafe Work Practices: Crewmember E wrapped the line attached to a block around his hand to maneuver it. When weight was applied, his hand became trapped, causing him to be dragged overboard. This unsafe system of work was a direct cause of the incident.\nCasualty’s Inexperience and Lack of Training: The casualty was on his fourth trip aboard FV Séimi with limited maritime experience and no formal safety training. His lack of experience and insufficient training contributed to his inability to recognize the dangers, leading to the incident.\nLack of Risk Assessment and Safety Statement: There was no risk assessment or safety statement prepared for the vessel’s activities, as required by the Safety, Health, and Welfare at Work Act 2005. The absence of these safety measures was a contributing factor to the incident.\nNon-Compliance with Basic Safety Training Requirements: At the time of the incident, only two out of five crew members had valid BIM Safety Training Cards, with three crew members lacking basic safety training. The owner and skipper’s failure to ensure all crew members met the minimum safety training standards contributed to the incident.\nFailure to Wear Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs): The casualty was not wearing a lifejacket or PFD when he went overboard, violating legal requirements. The failure to enforce the use of PFDs was another contributing factor to the incident.\nThe Conclusions and Safety Recommendations from the MCIB report on the FV Séimi include the following:\nConclusions:\nThe owner or Master of an Irish registered fishing vessel must ensure sufficient qualified crew are onboard, which was not adhered to on FV Séimi.\nThe validity of the Declaration of Compliance (DoC) is contingent on the vessel being maintained, equipped, and operated in compliance with the Code of Practice (CoP). FV Séimi did not meet these requirements.\nA significant portion of recent MCIB reports involved fishing vessels, indicating a need for greater attention to safety standards onboard such vessels .\nSafety Recommendations:\nRisk Assessment: The owner should conduct a risk assessment covering all onboard work activities, particularly in rough seas.\nSafety Statement: Prepare a safety statement as required by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.\nOperational Review: Review the procedure for shooting pots, considering automation or developing clear procedures when manual operation is necessary.\nCrew Training: Establish a system for ensuring that both new and existing crew receive necessary onboard training and familiarization before being assigned any potentially dangerous tasks.\nREAD THE FULL INVESTIGATION REPORT INTO A MARINE CASUALTY  INVOLVING THE  FISHING VESSEL SÉIMI BY CLICKING HERE\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

The pot was hauled, but the missing man was not found.\nThe Hunter was fishing snow crab in an area of the east Barents Sea known by the fleet as good crabbing ground when the accident happened. After searches in the area were exhausted yesterday, Wednesday 01 February, it was confirmed by police the Hunter was on its way back to Tromso harbour in northern Norway.\nThe incident onboard the Hunter brings the number of drowning accidents in Norway during January this year to four, all of whom were men. The other three incidents were:\nA young man in his late teens was found dead in the sea after being reported missing after a party on Averøy in Møre og Romsdal.\nA man in his 60s fell into the sea when he was about to board a fast boat in Abelvær in Trøndelag.\nIn Agder, a man in his 40s died in a diving accident outside Arendal.\nHunter was built in Norway in 1989 and is 45 metres long. The vessel has accommodation for 23 crew members and has a gross tonnage of 840. The vessel can produce both cooked frozen and raw frozen.\nAccording to Marine Traffic, the vessel fished as a trawler in the UK between 2010 and 2013 as UNITY (FR165).\nFollow The Fishing Daily\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nDisclaimer\nSearch for:\nDive into the Marine Institute and Fisheries Management with Dr Ciaran Kelly\nhttps://youtu.be/kdn4MfMLEyUIrish Fish Processing Industry Facing Uncertain Futurehttps://youtu.be/iOS3-aWj10I\nRecent Posts\nNorwegian Fishing Industry Opposes Offshore Wind Storage Expansion\nNew Fisheries Minister Appointed as Industry Looks to the Future\nBIM Conference to Guide Seafood Firms on Growth & Succession\nUK’s 2025 Marine Strategy Puts Fisheries Sustainability in Focus\nEU Tuna Fleet Stresses Science-Based Management in RFMOs\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAppointments\nBIM News\nBusiness Features\nCatchCam News\nChannel Islands\nDanish Fishing Industry\nEU Fishing Industry\nEuropean Fishing Industry\nEvents and Webinars\nFD Podcast – Season 2\nFD Podcast – Season 3\nFD Podcast – Season 4\nFD Podcast – Season 5\nFD Podcasts – Season 1\nFeatured News\nIcelandic Fishing Industry\nInternational Fishing News\nIrish Fishing Industry\nIsle of Man Fishing News\nJob Opportunities\nLatest News\nLetters to the Editor\nLibrary Features\nMarine Institute News\nMarketplace\nMeet My Fishmonger\nNew Builds\nNI Fishing Industry News\nNorwegian Fishing Industry\nNuacht Iascaireachta\nPêche Professionnelle Française\nResqunit News\nScience and Research\nScottish Fishing Industry\nSeafood Business News\nSpotlight Features\nTech Features\nThe Fishing Daily Tech Talk Podcast\nUK Fishing Industry\nCONTACT US:\n+353(0)83 826 8406 (editor) +353(0)83 826 8406 (sales)\n[email protected] [email protected]\nNAVIGATION:\nHomeFishing NewsBusiness FeaturesSeafood NewsAdvertising SolutionsThe Fishing Daily PodcastContactAbout The Fishing Daily\nNAVIGATION:\nIrish Fishing NewsScottish Fishing NewsUK Fishing NewsEU Fishing NewsEuropean Fishing NewsIcelandic Fishing NewsDanish Fishing NewsNorwegian Fishing News\nFOLLOW US:\nFollowFollowFollowFollowFollow\nIf you have a fishing news related story call or WhatsApp Oliver on +353 83 826 8406 or email [email protected]\nCopyright © 2020 – 2025 The Fishing Daily.

In a concerning turn of events, rescuers are keeping up the search for a 19 year old fisherman who was reported missing at sea in Ao Prachuap, or Prachuap Bay, located in Thailand’s Prachuap Khiri Khan province. The young man, identified as Pokaphon Chomchaw from Bangsaphan district, was reported missing on Sunday. Advertisements\nPokaphon’s disappearance was brought to the authorities’ attention by Wisanu Pinobchay, the owner of the fishing boat Lap. Wisanu reported the disappearance to the National Maritime Law Enforcement Center of Prachuap Khiri Khan, according to Hua Hin Today. Pokaphon was last seen near the Khlong Wan sub-district municipality, approximately 3.5 nautical miles offshore. A swift search and rescue operation was launched, involving 32 local fishing boats, two patrol boats, and two jet skis, all working together to find the missing fisherman.

Despite their painstaking efforts, Pokaphon has not been located. The vice governor of Prachuap Khiri Khan, Maj. Adisak Noisawan, conveyed his deep concern for the missing man’s family during this trying time. He assured the family that rescuers are putting forth all their efforts to find Pokaphon, and expressed hope for his swift and safe recovery. As the search continues, the rescuers remain determined to locate the young fisherman and are doing everything possible to bring him back to safety. Advertisements\nLast month, a fishing crew member tragically drowned at sea near Prachuap Khiri Khan after resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. Investigations into the cause of death revealed that the victim was holding onto a net while fishing in the middle of the sea. The rope used to fasten the net broke, which consequently led to the victim being pulled into the sea by the net’s weight.

The angler, Lidier Murillo, 43, was fishing along the Coto River, outside Golfito, when the tragedy occurred.\nAccording to a witness, Murillo was grabbed by the crocodile with is friend Alvaro Rodriguez.  Murillo had waded out into the river mouth while Rodriguez was fishing from shore.\nAccording to local media reports, Murillo cried out for help when the beast grabbed him.  Rodriguez was initially able to reach him but the crocodile soon began to drag them both out to deeper water.\nRodriguez was quickly able to find a heavy piece of wood and began to beat and stab at the crocodile resulting in Murillo being released from its grasp.\nRodriguez pulled his friend out of the water and onshore. However, while he went to get help from other fisherman nearby the crocodile returned to grab Murillo again.\nWith the help of fellow anglers, Rodriguez and the others were able to once again free Murillo and get him to shore.\nUnfortunately, the injuries suffered by Murillo were very severe and by the time ambulances arrived to the remote area, he was pronounced dead on the scene.\nPopular Articles\nUSA And Germany Take Top Honors At Costa Rica Coffee Bowl Tennis Tournament\nLast week marked the 60th edition of the traditional Copa del Café (Coffee Bowl).

The recent fire mishap in Vizag fishing harbour highlighted the owners' reluctance to pay high premiums for insurance. There are over 2,000 mechanised fishing boats in the state, with 700 in Vizag fishing harbour alone. The cost of insuring a fishing boat, which can be up to 50 lakh, is not mandatory. However, the high premiums, ranging from 25,000 to 50,000 per year, deter many boat owners. Lower income group fishers are particularly concerned about the expensive marine insurance schemes.Rs 25 crore loss: 45 fishing boats gutted in fire at Vizag fishing harbour45 mechanised fishing boats were reduced to ashes in a fire at Visakhapatnam fishing harbour. No loss of life is reported. The property loss is estimated to be several crores. The fire started during a party on one of the boats or after a fight between two groups of fishermen.

The fishing boat -- Suja Mol -- sailed from Colachel fishing harbour on September 25 with 16 fishermen, including six north Indians, onboard.While they were fishing 38 nautical miles off the Kanyakumari coast, the boat capsized after being caught in a huge tidal wave.According to accounts of fishermen, the fishermen were unloading a rather handsome haul of catch on the trawler when they were hit by the huge wave. The wave hit the astern and filled the deck with water. The boat tilted dangerously at the astern before another massive wave hit the boat. All the fishermen aboard were thrown into the sea. The fishermen did not have time to reach out to their VHF wireless sets to send out an SOS. Other boats in the vicinity saw Suja Mol taking water and sinking astern down. They rushed to the aid of fishermen. Three boats pulled out 13 fishermen, eight on one boat, four on another and one fisherman -identified as Michael â on yet another boat. Michael was brought ashore by the trawler -- that sailed from Chinnamuttom harbour -- by Friday evening. He was taken to his house in Colachel, and the family admitted him to a private hospital later. Meenavar Orunginaippu Sangam Secretary Johnson Charles said the other 12 rescued fishermen were likely to reach Colachel by Friday night. The Indian Coast Guard was alerted. Coast Guard Ship Atulya based in Tuticorin Coast Guard station was directed to assist in the search operations. The ship reached the accident spot. âAlong with the shop, some 20 trawlers that were in the vicinity are also looking out for three fishermen who went missing,â said Charles. The fishermen fear that these missing fishermen should have been caught in the net and trapped in the sinking boat. âThe boat is lying at the bottom of the sea, at least 50 metre deep. We have requested divers from Tuticorin but they canât dive beyond 20 metre. We need saturation divers who can dive deeper. We are appealing to the Indian Navy to provide their experts to search for our missing fishers in the wreckage of the boat lying at the bottom of the sea,â added Charles.

He was last seen on Friday evening. His absence was noticed by other crew members around 8.45pm that day. A Christian, 51, from Chinnathurai was part of the 11-member crew of fishing boat Felaxiya, owned by Austin Jose. Felaxiya sailed from Kochi harbour on April 5. âWe received a call from the boat through a satellite phone that Christian was missing,â said Rethi John, brother of Christian. John said that the boat ownerâs brother told them that he had alerted the local fisheries and marine police officials. However, the family members are worried since it has been three days and they are not able to reach the boat owner. âWe have been appealing to the authorities to look out for him,â said John. Justin Antony from International Fishermen Development Trust said that the coordinates of the boat when the crew noticed Christianâs absence were relayed to the Indian Coast Guardâs (ICG) Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. âWe suspect that he should have fallen 15 or 20 minutes before the crew realized that he was missing,â said Antony. ICG communicated to the family members that it had directed its ship Sajag to launch a search for Christian and undertake a surface search.

The deceased is Johny, a resident of Puthukurichy. The boat capsized at 3.30am when Johny and the other five fishermen ventured into the sea for fishing. At that time, the sea was very rough.However, the other five fishermen managed to swim safely to the shore. But Johny went missing.The fishermen and others from a nearby boat attempted to rescue Johny initially, but the forceful waves thwarted their efforts. His body was later found near a cliff and shifted to the nearby hospital. Later, his body was transferred to Chirayinkeezh Taluk Hospital. The body was later handed over to relatives.Meanwhile, the Latin Catholic Church association has warned the state govt that the fishermen would go for a protest if the ongoing issue at Muthalapozhi is not resolved.The fishermen of the area said the sea has been rough, and the unscientific way the harbour was built has increased the severity of accidents.For the past nine years, there have been more than 60 incidents of fishermen drowning at Muthalapozhi and nearby seas, according to the local fishermen. The fishermen have been raising the complaint that faulty construction of the harbour is one of the main reasons behind the surging incidents of drowning at Muthalapozhi. They maintain that sand has been accumulating alarmingly at the mouth of the âpozhiâ, reducing the manoeuvrability of the vessels.We also published the following articles recentlyFishermen seek policy changes, devpt authorityVisakhapatnam fishermen community faces migration issues, demands modern boats, subsidies, and classification under MBC category for equitable access to opportunities.

John Paul of Ennakkidangu Purayidam House, Anchuthengu is the deceased. According to the police, the mishap occurred around 10.30am while Paul and fellow fishermen were returning to the shore after a nightlong fishing trip.He was part of a three-member crew that had set out into the sea from Anchughengu in a small boat fitted with an outboard engine. Paul was the one who was operating the outboard motor of the boat.The two fishermen who survived the mishap told the police that as the boat reached a distance of around three kilometres from the shore, its engine failed. However, strong winds and the current helped them drift close to the shore near Perumathura, around 500m south of the Muthalapozhi breakwater here. But, as they got closer to the shore, the intensity of the waves got stronger. They realized that the boat would crash against the shore owing to strong waves. Had it happened, the survival chances would have been lower. Hence they decided to abandon the boat and swim to the shore. While the two others managed to swim to safety, Paul could not. He drowned just a few metres away from the shore. His friends immediately dived back into the sea and helped him get to the shore. He was rushed to Chirayinkeezh Government District Hospital, but the doctors declared him dead on arrival. The police suspect that besides the strong waves, exhaustion might also have played a key role in the death of Paul. His friends told the police that until the moment they decided to abandon the boat, Paul was desperately trying to repair the motor and restart it. Paul is the fourth person to lose life in the sea at Anchuthengu. Three weeks ago, a five-year-old boy had died after he was swept away by strong waves while standing close to the sea along with his brother. Two days later, a 19-year-old man drowned after his boat capsized near Perumathura. A week later, a 57-year-old fisherman died after his boat capsized at the mouth of Muthalapozhi breakwater, which is a danger zone for the fishermen using small boats. All these mishaps, including the death of Paul on Saturday, have happened while the district collectorâs warning to stay away from the sea based on weather alerts was in effect. The collector had issued a warning on Friday asking fishermen not to venture into the sea till Tuesday after India Meteorological Department predicted strong winds with speed ranging from 40 to 45 km/hour along the coasts of Kerala, Karnataka and Lakshadweep. The collector has on Saturday extended the ban till Wednesday.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   Previous9 things that make Areca Palm the perfect indoor plantLifestyleSoaked moong dal benefits: 10 benefits for eating this energy powerhouse for breakfastLifestyleHow to make South Indian stye Paneer Dosa at homeFoodThe 8 perfect steps to grow âDhaniyaâ in the kitchen gardenLifestyle10 baby girl names that sound royalLifestyle15 Indian states and their famous state animalstravel10 delicious Indian dishes that can be made with raw bananaFoodHow to make protein-rich Lahori Paneer KormaFood8 fruits and veggies that can help get rid of eye glassesLifestyle10 green vegetables that have highest protein contentLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and moreFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episode5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 body language tips to appear more confident5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levels5 signs you are unknowingly being toxic to yourself, as per psychology6 Most Intuitive Zodiac Signs5 psychology tricks to make people magically like youBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestants9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGBrittany MahomesTyphoon KrathonMelania TrumpHarvard Application ProcessP DiddyWTC Points TableIran Missile StrikeActor GovindaTaylor SwiftPrince HarryTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteActor Govinda suffers bullet injury as revolver misfires, hospitalised'It's getting scarier, tougher': Indians living in Israel\"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomesâ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles\"What October Holds for Every Zodiac SignMiddle East tensions escalate: How Iran's missile strikes on Israel could impact Indiaâs economyNavratri 2024: Significance of Nine Colours and Their MeaningâIt's overâ: Taylor Swift's absence from the Chiefs games has sparked speculation about breakup with Travis KelceP Diddy: Attorney says he has a list of names that will shock public; 120 accusers allege sexual misconductShardiya Navratri 2024: Date, Ghatsthapana Muhurat, Rituals and SignificanceNavratri 2024 Day 1: Maa Shailputri, Puja Vidhi, Mantra, and Significance'Drink this water to get vote': Village dares candidates ahead of Haryana pollsDid Nasrallah agree to ceasefire with Netanyahu before his killing?A village in India with healthcare like Stanford?

The deceased Victor Thomas, 53, of Puthumanal Purayidam near Mambally at Anchuthengu, also tried to swim back to the shore along with them, but he went missing in a huge wave and his body was later recovered from the sea.With his death the total number of fishermen, who lost lives in the area, has crossed 80, said Eugine Periera, vicar general of Latin Archdiocese.He termed the death of Victor murder as the state govt is solely responsible for it. He was speaking after inaugurating the protest staged by the Kerala Latin Catholic Association in front of the legislative assembly. âDuring the end of our 140-day strike recently, the govt promised us seven remedies to solve the issues of the fishermen. Following it discussions were held and the fisheries minister promised us to hold an all-party meeting . But nothing has been done so far,â said Eugine.Owing to the pressure exerted by the fishermen, the CWPRS was asked to hold a study, he added.âOn the basis of this study, the state govt sent a proposal to the Centre worth just Rs 50 crore for curbing the mess. However, the Centre rejected the project by terming it a farce and later a new proposal worth Rs 164 crore was submitted. No proper discussion has been done on it later. Till we get a precise response from the govt, we will not withdraw from the strike,â said Eugine.We also published the following articles recentlyBihar: Boat capsizes in Ganga river at Barh in Patna, 13 rescued so far, 4 missingA boat carrying 17 passengers capsized in the Ganga river near Umanath ganga ghat in Patna. 11 rescued, 6 missing.

Mauvin Godinho, the industries minister, expressed his frustration and stated that he will ask the Centre for intervention. Godinho emphasized the importance of addressing this issue promptly, as it is affecting the port's profitability, the economy, and the industry.

Godinho plans to discuss the matter with the chief minister and the Union minister for shipping and ports.Three fishermen missing after boat from TN capsizes in seaThree fishermen are missing after their boat capsized off the coast of Tamil Nadu.

But their boats toppled due to a strong gust of wind and thunderstorm. Both went missing in the waters.Though the relatives launched a search in the waters to rescue the missing persons, their efforts proved futile. The locals said that the boats were not strong enough to withstand strong wind.Jogaiahâs body was found near Yaradavalasa on Saturday and Seetharamâs body was found at another place on Sunday.Sub-Inspector M V Ramana said that the duo tried to swim to safety after their boats toppled but they failed to swim safely to shore and drowned.A case has been registered under Section 174 of CrPC and the bodies were shifted for the post-mortem, he added.

The collision was reported five nautical miles north of Katchatheevu Island. NEW DELHI: India on Thursday summoned the Sri Lankan acting high commissioner and registered a strong protest over the collision earlier in the day between a Lankan navy vessel and an Indian fishing boat that left an Indian fisherman dead. Another Indian fisherman was reported missing after the collision.Indian government expressed shock and anguish at the loss of life and the Indian high commissioner in Colombo, Santosh Jha, also raised the matter with the Lankan govt later on Thursday.Recalling that India has always emphasised the need to deal with issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, Indian authorities told the Lankan govt that existing understandings between the two govts in that regard must be strictly observed. \"Utmost efforts should be made to ensure that there is no recurrence or resort to the use of force,\" said the Indian govt in a statement.The collision was reported five nautical miles north of Katchatheevu Island. Out of the four Indian fishermen who were on board the vessel, one unfortunately lost his life and another is missing, according to the Indian govt.\"Two of the fishermen have been rescued and brought ashore to Kankesanthurai. A search is ongoing for the missing Indian fisherman. Indian consulate officials in Jaffna have been instructed to immediately rush to Kankesanthurai and extend all possible assistance to the fishermen and their families,'' it said, adding that India attaches the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian fishermen. Issues relating to Indian fishermen have been raised regularly at the highest levels with the Sri Lankan leadership, it said.This is the second such incident reported between a Lankan naval vessel and an Indian fishing boat in recent times. In June, Sri Lanka had registered a protest with India for the death of a navy sailor who was killed while attempting to seize an Indian vessel allegedly poaching in Lankan waters. The sailor sustained critical injuries due to \"the aggressive manoeuvres of the Indian trawler, resisting its seizure\".Sri Lanka had detained 10 Indian fishermen for causing the death of the sailor. The MEA had later raised the issue with Lankan authorities and sought their release. Sri Lanka has in the past diplomatically conveyed to India its opposition to alleged IUU fishing, especially bottom trawling and indiscriminate poaching, by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksIllia YefimchykArvind Kejriwal BailAnnapurna Interactive Staffs ResignedEx-Miss Switzerland FinalistHaitian ImmigrantsStock Market TodayDelhi Greater Kailash shootingTOP TRENDINGPolaris DawnGK for StudentsVande MetroHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesShimla ProtestsKolkata Rape Murder CaseNitin GadkariAadhar Card UpdateGarena Free Fire Redeem CodeLargest Mammals in the WorldTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteThe Secret Behind NFL Marriages: How These Couples Make It WorkUPI transaction limit to change from September 16!

This comes on the heels of three other Tobago fishermen who went out to sea last week being allegedly held with drugs in Barbados, where they are now in quarantine.“My brother did not know anything about what was planned. He informed one of the senior police officers in the village that he was going fishing by the rig. He, Pastor George and another man, but he did not know the other man,” Makini Williams said.She was told by the two fishermen who made it back to shore that while at sea they went fishing in separate areas.“My brother was looking for dolphin, the other fishermen were looking for barracuda. The barracuda and the dolphin was not in the same place so they went off a little from each other and were to reach back at the same spot to come back in,” she said.All Tobago Fisherfolk Association president Curtis Douglas told the Express that searches continue to be conducted by fishermen across Tobago for Williams, as well as the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard.“Words cannot describe how I feel about the current situation. We hope for his safe return,” Douglas said.Commenting on some fishermen being involved in illegal activity, he said: “We have a zero tolerance concerning drug activity. We do not condone or conduct that kind of behaviour.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nTobago Fisherman\nAtiba Williams\nMissing At Sea\nFishing Vessel\nTft 1730 Mak’ Mak'\nCanoe Bay\nMakini Williams\nRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\nMissing man's ID found near skeletal remains\nPolice searching for a kidnapped central businessman in St James on Tuesday, found an employ…\nMurder at School Street, Esperanza\nA man was killed and another wounded in a shooting in Couva on Tuesday night.\nAccused of child molestation, man dies by suicide\nA man accused of molesting a seven year old child, is believed to have died by suicide in ea…\n'CAL aircraft have had multiple safety-rela­ted near misses'\nTrinidad and Tobago Airline Pilots Association (TTALPA) industrial relations representative …\nSquatters at Ramjattan Trace hold protest: Upset over ‘questionable’ notice to vacate\nRESIDENTS squatting at Ramjattan Trace, Tumpuna Road, La Horquetta, are fearful of losing th…\nKamla: ‘Rajesh’ Young now acknowledging roots\nOPPOSITION Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar has questioned whether prime minister-in-waiting St…\nRecommended for you\nTRENDING\nBody found in shallow grave\nSchool of Accounting and Management founder passes away\nGRIEF ON THE BEACH\nCop on kidnap/rape charges arrested for child sex crimes\nPilot, 2 technicians ‘withdrawn’ after CAL plane emergency\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nTweets by expressupdates\nInstagram\nTop\nNews\nLocal\nRegional\nWorld\nSports\nLocal\nRegional\nWorld\nFootball\nBasketball\nCricket\nMore\nBusiness\nLocal\nRegional\nWorld\nFeatures\nLocal\nEditorial\nWoman\nEditorial\nExpress Editorial\nContributors\nLetters\nLocal\nWorld\nU.S.\nRest of the World\nSubscription\nLocal\nRegional\nWorld\nContact Us\nMake Contact\nAdvertising\nTrinidad Express\nExpress Classifieds\nAgency\nDirect\nFeedback\nLet us know\nSocial Channels\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\n© 2023 Caribbean Communications Network.

(WGME)TOPICS:KennebunkportCoast GuardFishermanSearchMissingBoatKulesaShoreKENNEBUNKPORT (WGME) -- The search is on for a Maine fisherman missing off the coast of Kennebunkport.He was supposed to come back to shore Thursday afternoon but never returned.Friday morning, crews found his boat and other belongings, but no sign of him.Also read:Coast Guard launches search for missing 64-year-old fisherman off coast of KennebunkportIt was already dark, around 7 p.m., when police contacted the Coast Guard.“Inherently, searching at night does have its challenges. It does have its limitations,” Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator Commander Frank Kulesa said.Throughout the day, authorities have looked from the air, off the coast and along the shore.So far, they say they’ve found his boat overturned on the rocks by Walker’s Point Friday morning, along with a boot, a plastic tote, fishing gear and life jackets.“The potential area the missing fisherman can be in is a very tight area, close to shore,” Kulesa said.Also read:1 victim, 1 suspect killed in New Hampshire State Hospital shootingThey’re focused on looking from Walker’s Point to Turbats Creek.A man who identified himself as a friend says the missing boater is a longtime lobsterman and would go out around an island.The U.S. Coast Guard confirms he was out relocating some lobster pots.“We’ve had a number of fishermen and volunteer responders who have come out and aided in the search,” Kulesa said.The Coast Guard says they’ve had good visibility and not very strong winds, which helps.Large tidal cycles and the rocky coastline are creating challenges for searchers.“If you're an experienced mariner and you can get out on your boat, by all means, if you can do that safely, we'd welcome that assistance, walking shorelines,” Kulesa said. “We just don't want people taking unnecessary risks.”Also read:Scribner's Bridge in Harrison closed due to failed inspectionsAuthorities don’t believe the man was wearing a wetsuit, and they’re unsure if he had on a lifejacket.With water temperatures around 50 degrees, officials are aware that’s a serious concern.“At this point in time, we are still operating under that this is a search and rescue, and we're going to continue as long as there's a chance for survival,” Kulesa said.Authorities say all signs point to that he did go into the water.If you live along the water nearby and find anything that might be related to this search, you can contact the local police.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...",

As of this posting, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) in Surigao City reported that a search was underway for the remaining passengers in the area.\nUnfortunately, solid waves in the waters at San Ricardo, Southern Leyte, wrecked the bow section of their fishing boat. The two people are survivors of a marine catastrophe in which six fishermen went missing on March 1, 2024, according to reports.\n“They managed to report the incident to their relatives through phone calls but lost communications due to an unstable network connection,” the CGS-SDN report read.\nThe six abandoned their damaged fishing boat and went swimming together, but the strong current caused them to split up. The CGS-SDN is still in contact with other Coast Guard units in case any of the four fishermen who may still be missing are spotted.\nWe urge the general public to render the necessary assistance and immediately report to authorities if they are sighted,” CGS-SDN station commander Jerick Maglangit said.\nThe rescued fishermen were later returned to the City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office of Surigao City for immediate medical treatment.\nAs of this date, Coast Guard Station Surigao del Norte continuously coordinated with other PCG units and the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO)  through CDRRMO Surigao City for the possible sightings of the remaining four missing fishermen who are still nowhere to be found which possibly drifted at their respective area of responsibility.\nSources:(1),(2)Keep Reading: VP Sara commends anti-insurgency programs in Davao Region\nPrevious: Gela Atayde Clarifies Sister Ria’s Pregnancy Rumors Amid PCOS Challenges\nNext: PBBM arrives in Melbourne for ASEAN-Australia summit\nWhatALife ContributorContributor writers of WhatALife!\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

It’s unfortunate that the usual tradition turned out to be sorrowful this time.”\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

(ABC Capricornia: Jasmine Hines)\"We don't believe the vessel has struck anything, but it has capsized in rough water,\" he said. \"The three men are experienced boatmen and fishermen, they were familiar with the area and the conditions.\"He said steep waves and poor conditions were believed to have contributed to the incident.The boat, which has sunk 18 metres underwater, has also been located and a dive squad will work to recover it.Inspector Wiltshire said officers would also investigate why an EPIRB was not set off. \"It is possible there was an EPIRB on the boat but there was no time to set it off,\" he said.A Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the distressed fishermen were taken to Rockhampton Hospital in a stable condition with minor injuries.A report will be prepared for the Coroner.A map of the search area for the fishermen in central Queensland.

(ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)Mr Cowie said the men who were located were lucky to have made it to shore. \"It was a fairly treacherous incident from the time they found themselves in the water to when they were able to get through to land,\" he said. An RACQ Capricorn Helicopter Rescue said the service had also joined the search for the missing fishermen today.The Narrows is a 40-kilometre saltwater channel between the mouth of the Fitzroy River and Gladstone Harbour, inhabited by sharks and crocodiles.The northern outlet fishing spot connects to Keppel Bay and separates Curtis Island from the mainland.Crocodiles and sharks inhabit the 40km saltwater channel between the Fitzroy River mouth and Gladstone Harbour.

Men det er jo ikke bare havet som er arbeidsplassen til fiskerne. Det er også fartøyet, skriver Ingunn Marie Holmen (t.h.) og Trine Thorvaldsen fra Sintef Ocean.\nFoto: Kari Williamson, SintefDe dør mens de skaffer oss mat fra havet. Kan vi leve med det?   Ingunn Marie Holmen  Forskningsleder, Sintef Ocean Trine Thorvaldsen  Seniorforsker, Sintef Ocean  Siden år 2000 har hele 157 yrkesfiskere mistet livet. Kan vi leve med at så mange dør på jobb for å skaffe mat til fellesskapet? Publisert:\n22. januar 2025 kl. 11:55\nOppdatert:\n22. januar 2025 kl. 11:55\nDu leser nå en kronikk. Den uttrykker innsenderens mening.De siste ukene har det vært stor oppmerksomhet rundt de høye drukningstallene for 2024, blant annet på lederplass i Adressa. Det er dessverre ikke bare fra fritidsbåter for mange drukner.En lørdag i august 2023 legger en sjark ut fra kai i Mehamn i Finnmark. Fiskeren skal på kongekrabbefangst og er alene i båten. På vei inn Tanafjorden setter han ut lenker med krabbeteiner. Når den sjette lenka går over rekka, sitter noe fast. Sjarken mister fart, fiskeren prøver å løse floka. I sin rapport antar Havarikommisjonen at han hekter seg fast i tauverket.Tungt utstyr og lunefull natur utfordrer sikkerheten til havs. Men det er likevel fullt mulig for samfunnet å gjøre arbeidsplassen til fiskere tryggere. Ved nyttår lanserte Sjøfartsdirektoratet en historisk handlingsplan for økt sikkerhet til havs. Det er vi som har forsket på dette temaet i over 20 år, glade for. For det trengs.Vi vet at mange fiskere elsker friheten og selvstendigheten i yrket. De tar risikoen med på kjøpet, slik generasjonene før dem har gjort. I primærnæringer til vanns og til lands må man håndtere uventede hendelser helt alene og ta raske beslutninger i situasjoner som kan ha store økonomiske konsekvenser. Da trengs det barrierer som kan forhindre de verste ulykkene. Selvstendig næringsdrivende på sjøen henger dessverre etter kollegene i landbasert primærnæring. De tre næringene med høyest andel dødsulykker, når vi ser ulykkestallene opp mot antall sysselsatte, er fiskeri, havbruk og landbruk – i den rekkefølgen.Havet er et sted der ulykker fort får store konsekvenser, ikke minst for alenefiskere. Men det er jo ikke bare havet som er arbeidsplassen til fiskerne. Det er også fartøyet. Og denne arbeidsplassen blir forma av regler, kvoter og reguleringer som myndighetene fastsetter. Samfunnet, ikke naturen, avgjør hvilke båter det er økonomisk forsvarlig å bruke.Samfunnet, ikke naturen, fastsetter hvordan fiskekvotene fordeles.Det er samfunnet, ikke naturen, som utvikler teknologien som kunne forhindret at fiskere faller over bord, blir klemt eller skadd av utstyr om bord.Det er samfunnet, ikke naturen, som bestemmer hvilke regler som gjelder for sikkerhetsutstyr.\nNaturen rår over vær og hav, men samfunnet kan og må gjøre fiskeryrket tryggere, skriver innleggsforfatterne fra Sintef Ocean.\nFoto: Anne-Marit DahlNaturen rår over vær og hav, men samfunnet kan og må gjøre fiskeryrket tryggere. Stortinget har vedtatt en visjon om at ingen skal dø mens de jobber på eller ved havet. Sjøfartsdirektoratets nye handlingsplan tar samfunnets ansvar og sammenhengen mellom rammer og sikkerhet på alvor. Ulykker skjer ikke i et vakuum. Vår forskning peker på at opplæring, fartøydesign, kvotepolitikk, sikkerhetsutstyr og regler knyttet til dette, spiller inn på den virkeligheten fiskeren står i den dagen hen for eksempel blir dratt med lenka med krabbeteiner over bord.Dagen etter at krabbefiskeren la ut fra Mehamn, er en venn av han på kaia. Han ser bilen til fiskeren stå på samme sted som dagen før. Han aner uråd og ringer inn en bekymringsmelding til Hovedredningssentralen. Nesten samtidig ringer en annen kollega inn samme melding. Sjarken ligger ikke til kai som forventa. Redningsmannskaper drar ut på fjorden og finner fiskeren flytende i vannet, nær en staur som markerte en krabbeteine. Båten har gått på grunn like ved, og motoren går fremdeles.Dette er en av mange dødsulykker Havarikommisjonen har gått inn i. Flere av dødsfallene kunne vært forhindret om næringa hadde vært underlagt andre påbud og krav. En sikkerhetsline kan hindre fall over bord. Nødstopp kan stoppe motoren om fiskeren faller. En trådløs alarmknapp som blir aktivert i kontakt med vann, kan varsle redningssentralen på land automatisk, slik at redningsaksjonen kunne blitt igangsatt umiddelbart.Ikke alle i næringa vil applaudere nye påbud. Sikkerhetsutstyr krever tilvenning og kan være en ekstra utgift. I den sammenheng kan vi minne om at sikkerhetsbelter i bil også var en uglesett nyvinning som aldri ville blitt tatt i bruk uten at de ble påbudt. Å innføre nye, selv upopulære, sikkerhetskrav er et ansvar myndighetene er nødt til å ta. De som skaffer oss mat på bordet, fortjener rammebetingelser som gjør det mulig å jobbe uten å risikere liv og helse. Fiskerne fortjener den omsorgen som ligger i strengere påbud, krav og økt tilsyn. Nå er en visjon blitt til plan. Den videre jobben er å gjøre planen om til handling. Vi venter spent på å se om myndighetene følger opp Sjøfartsdirektoratets arbeid med nødvendige ressurser.Hva mener du?

Crew members with burn injuries were carried to safety by coastguard personnel.\nThe wooden-hulled boat, which had bamboo outriggers, apparently developed engine trouble, the ensuing disaster leaving some crew members injured, forcing others to jump into the sea in panic.\nAccording to coastguard officials, a passing tugboat helped put out the blaze and a search and rescue operation was launched.\nSurvivors\nSurviving crew members, including the skipper, were still being treated at a hospital or were too traumatised to tell investigators what set off the explosion and resulting fire.

He and the only other crewmember, a 22-year-old deckhand, climbed onto the vessel's upturned hull shortly afterwards.The captain said another large wave later struck the vessel and swept both himself and the deckhand overboard. However, only the captain managed to climb back aboard the hull while the deckhand disappeared.A subsequent search operation by Good Samaritan vessels and helicopters concluded at around 12:30 when the missing deckhand was found unresponsive in the water. Tragically, he was pronounced deceased less than two hours later.EuropeFranceincidentsFrench NavyRose des Vents\nBaird Maritime\nBaird Maritime / Work Boat World\nwww.bairdmaritime.com\nINSTALL APP",

The fishing vessel then overturned with its crew of eight still on board six kilometres off the coast.After learning of the incident, the Korea Coast Guard immediately deployed divers, 15 vessels, and six helicopters to the area as part of the search and rescue (SAR) effort.Coast guard SAR teams eventually located seven crewmembers inside the overturned fishing vessel. These seven individuals were found suffering from cardiac arrest and were then transported to hospital, where they were later pronounced deceased.Geungwang's crew at the time of the incident included three South Koreans and five foreign nationals. One crewmember, identified as an Indonesian national, remains unaccounted for, coast guard officials said.No injuries have meanwhile been reported among the 10 crewmembers on the barge.The incident is the fourth fatal fishing vessel capsizing to occur in South Korean waters since the beginning of the year. Monday's capsizing and the three separate incidents that occurred in March, September, and November have a combined death toll of at least 16.AsiaincidentsIndonesiaSouth KoreaKorea Coast GuardGeungwang\nBaird Maritime\nBaird Maritime / Work Boat World\nwww.bairdmaritime.com\nINSTALL APP",

Ohama Maru No 8's 20-strong crew at the time of the incident included 15 Japanese and five Indonesian nationals. Of this number, 17 have been rescued while two are confirmed dead and three were reportedly thrown overboard and have not yet been found.The deceased and the missing crewmen have all been identified as Japanese nationals aged between 40 and 80.A survivor later told coast guard investigators that the vessel tilted heavily and overturned after one of its nets caught a large quantity of fish.The coast guard is continuing to conduct SAR operations off Kitaibaraki to attempt to locate the missing crewmen.The crews of other vessels that were also in the area when the capsizing occurred told local news outlet NHK that the conditions at the time were calm, making it unlikely that the weather was a contributing factor in the tragedy.AsiaJapanincidentsIndonesiaJapan Coast GuardOhama Maru No 8\nBaird Maritime\nBaird Maritime / Work Boat World\nwww.bairdmaritime.com\nINSTALL APP",

Peter Gray, of Cove in Berwickshire, was trying to untangle creels on the Saint Peter when the accident occurred.It prompted a major rescue operation on 2 May 2021 near Torness Point when the boat was found unmanned.An inquiry concluded the use of \"deck dividers\" to keep workers clear of ropes might have avoided the accident.Sheriff Donald Corke also found that the 64-year-old's chances of survival were reduced by the absence of a boarding ladder, which might have allowed him to climb back on board, and the fact that he was not wearing a personal locator beacon.Mr Gray was found by a helicopter rescue crew several hours after going into the water and was flown to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where he was pronounced dead. In his report into the accident, the sheriff said the shock of being immersed in cold water probably caused a fatal heart attack, possibly exacerbated by a history of heart disease. He recommended fishing boat owners should install deck dividers to improve safety and fit ladders or overside tyres so that anyone lost overboard could climb back onto a vessel. He also suggested people operating single-handed vessels in particular should carry personal locator beacons.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said they were airlifted to safety on Monday from Bedwell Island, some 330km (205 miles) west of the town of Broome in Western Australia.But nine others are feared dead.The survivors said their two boats were hit by the powerful Tropical Cyclone Ilsa last week, sinking one boat.Nine of the 10 crew members on that vessel are still missing. The sole survivor is reported to have been in the ocean for hours, clinging onto a jerry can, before being picked up by the fishermen from the other boat, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.That boat was pictured washed ashore on the small Bedwell Island. The surviving fishermen were eventually spotted by an Australian Border Force aircraft, and evacuated by a rescue helicopter to Broome, where they are being treated in hospital. They are \"all reported to be in good health despite their ordeal\", a Border Force spokesperson said, as quoted by the ABC, adding that the government was now working to \"repatriate the group as soon as practical\".Cyclone Ilsa, the strongest storm in the region in about 14 years, hit Western Australia last week - but it spared populated areas from major damage.Bedwell island lies near the Rowley Shoals - a series of coral reefs off Western Australia's coast.Powerful Cyclone Ilsa hits Western AustraliaWestern AustraliaIndonesiaRelatedThe newest victims of Australia's homelessness crisis30 Jul 2024AustraliaRare blind and hairy mole spotted in Australia9 Apr 2024AustraliaMissing family found alive in flooded outback14 Mar 2024AustraliaMore10 Jan 2025A purification ceremony to cleanse body and soulA purification ceremony in Bali is trending on TikTok.

However, this amount is often not sufficient when there is no income from the sea, according to the outlet.Some local biologists have advised divers not to wear black wetsuits, as they might be mistaken for seals, and also recommend painting white stripes on the suits to look like a poisonous coral snake, per Tracking Sharks.Some fishing organizations have also called on the government to purchase devices that could deter sharks, such as shark shields or devices that emit electrical impulses that deter sharks.\nRead next\nMexico\nRecommended video\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\nsubscribers.

Le Roux stated that families of persons believed to be missing at sea in the vicinity have been notified to assist police and government Health Forensic Pathology Services with identification of the deceased. “Our thoughts are with those families in this difficult time.”\nMissing fisherman south of Cape Point\nMeanwhile, a search has ensued following reports of a man overboard and missing from a fishing vessel 11 nautical miles south of Cape Point.\nStation commander of the NSRI Simonstown, Darren Zimmerman, said the local fishing vessel that the fisherman had gone overboard from was engaged in a search and MRCC (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre) had tasked another local fishing vessel to assist in the search. “The fisherman had reportedly fallen overboard while they were laying fishing gear. The alarm was immediately raised and the skipper had turned the vessel around and they had initiated a search,” said Zimmerman.\nHe added that upon arrival on the scene, they found that the casualty vessel had sustained fishing rope fouled around her propellors and although she was unable to actively continue to assist in the ongoing search, her crew were all on the lookout for their fellow ship mate. “The two NSRI sea rescue craft joined the second fishing vessel in an extensive search operation. The crews of at least seven fishing vessels that were in the vicinity at the time were keeping a lookout for the missing fisherman.”\n“Despite an extensive search there remains no sign of the missing fisherman,” he said.\nThe NSRI Simonstown and NSRI Hout Bay sea rescue craft returned to base in the early hours of the morning and local fishing vessels are continuing to keep a lookout for the missing fisherman.\nAlso read:\nBeached dolphin, fishermen, drowning couple – NSRI rescues in one day\nPicture: Cape {town} Etc gallery\nArticle written by Sinazo Mkoko\n← Previous Next →\nSubscribe Today\nNewsletter\nCapeTownETC\nAbout\nWebsite Privacy Policy\nCookies & Privacy Policy\nTs & Cs\nContact\nAdvertising\nSponsored\nGolf News\nCOVID-19 Corona Virus\nSouth African Resource Portal\nDaddy's Deals\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\ncheap cars for sale\ncheap cars for sale in western cape\ncheap cars for sale in cape town\nJoburg news\nNews in Johannesburg\nBikes for sale\nPowered By\nCAPE TOWN OFFICE:  36 Old Mill Road, Ndabeni, Maitland, 7405, Western Cape > Telephone: (021) 530 3300 > Fax: (021) 530 3333\n© Copyright 2023 CapeTown ETC\nPrimary Menu\nCulture\nCompetitions\nNews\nFood and Drink\nSecondary Menu\nHome\nNews\nWorld\nProperty\nTech\nSports\nWeather\nA slice of Gasant Abarder\nWhat’s On\nThings to do\nRestaurants\nShopping\nNightlife\nTravel\nWinelands\nOutdoor\nFamily & Kids\nCompetitions\nInsurance Quote\nJoburg ETC\nX\n﻿\nX\nSearch\n×\nShare your story!\nCLOSE\nX\n×\nWe only use cookies on this Site for particular features to work, the cookies do not collect and/or store any personal information about you.Ok",

(Nautical Thrills/FaceBook)Two generations of a family were lost after a boat capsized on Newfoundland's west coast this weekend, leaving a community in mourning.On Sunday morning, after a vessel carrying six people capsized, the Canadian Coast Guard ship Cape Edensaw was dispatched from Lark Harbour to the west coast.The coast guard launched a fast rescue craft into the water, recovering two bodies.They were Trevor Childs and his nephew Nicholas Skinner, says Fish, Food & Allied Workers secretary-treasurer Jason Spingle.\"We had hoped that we wouldn't have to deal with this again. And we're here and we try to make the best of it. Again, in this case here too, two very young people, I think, makes it extra harder,\" Spingle told CBC News.In 2022, Childs spoke with CBC News while attending a fish harvester safety association symposium in St. John's.\"On the ocean the weather changes minute by minute. As for myself, I fish in an open boat so I'm always aware of the weather,\" Childs said at the time.Spingle said he knew Childs, describing him a \"beautiful person. Very mild mannered and soft spoken.\"A few years ago Spingle said he visited Childs's home and met his wife and children, and recalled he was happy with his life and loved fishing.\"We were talking about ... a good future for him and his family,\" said Spingle.He said a lot of people could relate to Childs, as a fish harvester from a rural town who was focused on his community, the outdoors and his family.\"It's just heartbreaking for them, right? Three small children,\" he said. \"It's just hard to take down, really hard to take down that they don't have him anymore.\"Spingle added that Childs's father is a recently retired harvester who was on the beach helping set the lobster traps and was there when the tragedy unfolded on Sunday.Difficult season aheadNews of the deaths travelled across Newfoundland and Labrador on Sunday and drew condolences from government officials and members of the fishing industry.Spingle says the tragedy impacts people beyond the fishery.\"This is going to be a difficult season for everyone in the Bay of Islands,\" he said.Residents of Lark Harbour have been rocked by the deaths of two fishermen after a vessel capsized on Sunday. (Colleen Connors/CBC)On Monday night, mourners held a private vigil to offer support to those grieving in Lark Harbour and York Harbour.\"'Reeling' is the only word to really use. Nobody expects to lose anyone, let alone on the first day of the season.… And the way it went down, from what I understand, is devastating,\" Lark Harbour Deputy Mayor Ria MacDonald told CBC News on Monday.\"'Devastating' is too light of a term. It feels like the rug has been pulled right out from underneath us.… To lose not one, but two from the same family, it's unreal. It doesn't feel real.\"Days after the deaths, details about the fatal incident are still unclear.Initially Capt. Trevor Ackland, spokesperson for the Joint Task Force Atlantic in support of the Joint Rescue and Coordination Centre in Halifax, told CBC News that four people had been airlifted from a beach on the west coast and brought to hospital after a vessel was found capsized.However, the DFO later amended this version of events and said the four were airlifted to shore where they were treated by paramedics.It is unclear if those four people had been on the boat with Childs and Skinner when it was capsized or if they ventured into the water to help the pair.The name of the vessel is also unknown, though officials initially reported it was called the Miss Jenny.'It doesn't feel real,' says Lark Harbour deputy mayor following death of 2 fishermen2 people dead after vessel capsizes on Newfoundland's west coastTransportation Safety Board spokesperson Hugo Fontaine said they were aware of the incident\"We are currently gathering information and assessing the occurrence. We haven't deployed investigators on site, and don't have much to share for now,\" he wrote in an email.Support for familiesSpingle said unfortunately, fatalities are a part of the industry, and the union has brought on measures to help their members through a life insurance policy as well as an accidental death and dismemberment policy.There is a financial amount set for a natural death as well as a death deemed accidental, which also covers funeral expenses, said Spingle. In this case, he views it as an accidental death case and that will give some support to the family in the short-term.In addition, he said this was a workplace fatality and there will be coverage under workers compensation through WorkplaceNL.\"So we'll make sure that people are helped out in any way they need to be,\" said Spingle.Spingle said he plans to attend the funeral to pay his respects on behalf of the union.Download our free CBC News app to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

(CBC )Two people are dead following the sinking of a commercial cod boat off the northeast coast of Newfoundland, according to the RCMP.One person has been rescued and one is still missing, the force said Wednesday morning.The bodies of the dead have been recovered, according to a spokesperson for the police.The RCMP said local fishermen rescued one person from the shoreline and recovered two people who had died. Emergency services staff assessed the survivor and determined the person did not require further medical attention.Mark Gould, deputy superintendent of maritime search and rescue in Newfoundland and Labrador, said Wednesday afternoon the rescue and recoveries happened before the coast guard was notified.\"A vessel of opportunity came upon the incident and responded and rescued the one individual and recovered the two others,\" Gould said.\"At that point they called Labrador Coast Guard radio, which was the first indication that we had of a distress situation.\"Gould said the search area includes rocky shoreline, which makes the situation difficult but aircraft have been able to search the shoreline effectively.The search for the remaining missing crew member is ongoing, with support from local communities and from as far away as Deer Lake, Grand Falls-Windsor and Springdale.Gould said sea conditions were favourable at the time of the sinking and have remained so during the search. He said the coast guard has been in touch with the next of kin throughout the search.WATCH | No cell service and rocky terrain among challenges in search for missing boater: Search for missing boater expands to nearby land as ‘survivability’ window closes1 year agoDuration 1:01Mark Gould of the Canadian Coast Guard’s Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre in St. John's, said no cell service and rocky terrain are among the challenges in the ongoing search for a missing person after a boat sank off Fleur de Lys.\"We are reaching the end of the survivability window. The best case for survivability for this individual would have been had he made it ashore,\" Gould said. \"All these incidents hit communities really hard.\"The four crew members are believed to be from the small towns of Fleur de Lys and Coachman's Cove, on Newfoundland's Baie Verte Peninsula, according to the local parish priest, Camillus Ekodobe.The 23-foot boat went down about less than two kilometres away from Fleur de Lys around 3 p.m. Tuesday afternoon — about 100 metres off the shoreline. Canadian Coast Guard vessels CCGS Earl Grey, CCGS Conception Bay and the CCGS Pennant Bay are in the area to aid in the search and rescue efforts, along with two auxiliary vessels and PAL Airlines.A Canadian Forces Cormorant helicopter returned to the air Wednesday morning. Three ground search and rescue teams are searching the immediate area on land, and the RCMP's underwater recovery team has been deployed.Local vessels have also been helping in the response.Priest describes dramatic sceneEkodobe, a Roman Catholic priest, was en route to Fleur de Lys on Tuesday evening for a wake. When he arrived at the church, he was surprised to find it already half full. That's when he learned of the sunken boat, and the rescue mission that was ongoing.\"You could feel the grief in the air. It was like a cold chill in the air for everybody,\" he said Wednesday morning. The wake was cancelled as people used the church while they waited for word on the fate of the four people on board. \"It was so bad for everybody.

Let it turn to good. That's what everybody is praying for.\"'Devastating blow'Former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Tom Rideout, who's from Fleur de Lys, called the tragedy a \"devastating blow\" to the community.\"Everybody feels it because everybody is friends and everybody is related,\" he said from his family home Wednesday morning.\"My next-door neighbour, who I can look out and see his house next to mine, two of those people are related to that household.

(Simon Nakonechny/CBC)Life in the town has by and large always revolved around the sea, he said.\"The sea has brought us a lot of blessings but it can be a cruel master at times, and this community experienced that yesterday.\"The town is in shock, said Rideout.\"It's like we're all going around as zombies. We don't know what to do, we don't know what to say to each other,\" he said. \"When you see a person, you don't know where to start the conversation.

The pair was last heard from around 4 p.m. on Friday. (Submitted by Dwight Russell )Social SharingThe search for two missing fishermen from Mary's Harbour has resumed with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces and the coast guard Monday, after the official search off the coast of southern Labrador was called off Sunday night.In a Facebook post Monday, Labrador MP Yvonne Jones wrote that an RCAF maritime patrol plane and a coast guard vessel are now assisting in the search under the authorization of federal ministers after the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax decided to end its search.\"After many hours overnight with the family, coast guard, the federal [and] provincial ministers and pressing forward, the JRCC would still not revert back to SAR and maintained their position to move to recovery operations,\" wrote Jones.\"I have been assured that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) will be continuing to assist RCMP and other partners in this effort. All support needed will be provided.… I am also assured that all other support will be provided and coordinated as required by the RCMP.\"The JRCC tweeted around 9 p.m. Sunday that it had suspended the search for the Island Lady following more than 48 hours of searching an area off Mary's Harbour spanning 4,500 nautical square miles, in an effort that involved \"a significant number\" of aircraft and vessels.Regrettably, based on the results of the exhaustive search by a significant number of SAR aircraft and vessels over the last 48+ hours, a search covering over 4500 sq NM, the search for the two missing fishers aboard the FV Island Lady has been suspended.&mdash;@hfxjrcc'We've lost valuable time'Two men from Mary's Harbour, Marc Russell and Joey Jenkins, were aboard the Island Lady. Shortly after the search first ended Sunday, Russell's father asked in a Facebook post for the search to be extended by 24 hours.Dwight Russell told CBC News Monday afternoon he and other family members and searchers wanted that extra day to be able to bridge from a JRCC-led effort into a localized one, but that didn't happen. \"It's a duplication of services that could have just been continued, but we've lost valuable time,\" said Russell.WATCH | Marc Russell's family speaks about the search for the missing fishermenMissing fishermen3 years agoDuration 5:55The family of missing fisherman Marc Russell ask for more time for the search effort.Marc Russell's mother held a picture of her son as she said Monday's federal election played a role in the search disruption. The family said they pressed federal departments like the office of the prime minister, and had politicians tell them the search would continue — just as the JRCC called it off.\"We feel lost within the process. There's a breakdown of information somewhere,\" Jeanette Russell said.Marc Russell is one of two fishermen from Mary's Harbour missing since Friday. (Submitted by Jeanette Russell)CBC News has asked the JRCC and Canadian Coast Guard for comment.The search for the fishing vessel and its crew began Friday evening after it did not return to port by 5 p.m. NT. Russell said the crew had called in to the local fish plant shortly before that to say they were coming home with their catch, and Jenkins had also placed a call to his partner.\"Whatever happened from that point on, we don't know,\" said Russell.Local fishing crews were first out on the water, and joined a few hours later by the JRCC, Canadian Coast Guard, PAL Airlines and the Royal Canadian Air Force.Dozens protest called-off searchJeannette Russell asked earlier Monday for people to protest the end of the official search.\"Please just help us find our boys, so we can bring them home,\" she said.On Monday afternoon more than 70 people holding signs and chanting did exactly that, blocking the entrance to coast guard headquarters in downtown St. John's\"That could be you or me one day,\" said Nick Windsor, holding a sign over his head that read \"Continue the Search.\"\"Whether it's a car accident or on a boat, we want to be rescued. To see them being left alone, that's the worst feeling you could ever feel in this world.\"Despite repeated attempts at the front gate, the demonstrators couldn't get the attention of anyone inside.\"This office here, to ignore us the way they are, that just shows what our government is actually like,\" said Windsor.More than 70 people showed up to protest the called-off search at the coast guard building in St. John's.  (Jeremy Eaton/CBC)MHA Lisa Dempster spoke to the crowd through a megaphone, calling the situation \"an emotional time for everyone.\"The representative for Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair says she made calls to try and get a meeting with the JRCC, but was told that couldn't happen due to ongoing federal election. \"This is about saving lives,\" Dempster said to the crowd.\"What happens when governments go into election mode. Do we stop searching for people? No we don't.\"In a joint statement, provincial Fisheries Minister Derrick Bragg and Justice Minister John Hogan said the province is doing everything it can to support search efforts. According to the statement the Emergency Services Division of the Department of Justice and Public Safety has been working with Canadian Coast Guard officials, the JRCC, the Marine Rescue Sub-Centre and others since Saturday morning. The ESD offered rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft to aid in the search.The statement said when the RCMP took over the search on Sunday night, the ESD engaged with the RCMP, Government Air Services and a volunteer group called the Civil Air Search and Rescue Association. On Monday morning, a government water bomber was deployed from Deer Lake.Boat not foundThe demonstrators, many with ties to the Russell and Jenkin's families or Labrador, held signs pleading to extend the search by 24 hours, arguing weather had posed a challenge for search teams earlier this weekend.\"The first day of searching was hampered by wind and fog, and we felt that enough wasn't done,\" Dwight Russell said Monday morning. A single blue fishing tub was found Sunday, with a second tub and some fishing buckets found later. The items are believed to be from the Island Lady.But Russell said the search hasn't turned up anything that conclusively proves the boat sank, or that the men went into the water. \"We haven't found any part of the boat or the life ring. There was survival suits aboard the boat. We haven't seen any of that,\" he said. \"They would have floated to the surface if something happened, we would think.\"Search for Mary's Harbour fishermen enters 2nd day as N.L. communities hold vigils overnightRussell thanked all those who helped search and support so far — more than half a dozen Labrador communities held vigils for the men Saturday night — but said there was \"a dire lack of resources to address this situation.\"\"We're angry at the situation, but we're not angry at anyone in particular ... we're just asking for some humanity to this situation,\" said Jeanette Russell.\"I could understand if these vessels were needed in a search somewhere else. That would be totally understandable. But ... there are no other events right now where they are needed.\"Dwight Russell said the current crisis shines a light on a severe shortage of search and rescue services along Labrador's coast.\"We need public pressure to change all this ... I want to bring my son home. We want to bring Joey home... it should never have come to this,\" he said.On Twitter, the JRCC said the matter has now been turned over to the RCMP as a missing persons at sea case. Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorWith files from Jonny Hodder and Anthony GermainCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The 57-year-old man from Muswodi Tshisimani would often venture to the local Nwanedi Dam and fish, keeping some of his catch for himself and selling the rest to the community.\nLast Sunday, however, Phaswana went to the dam as usual with a friend and tried to launch his self-made boat onto the water. He, however, ran into trouble during his second attempt and the boat sank, causing him to drown.\nPolice’s search and rescue workers retrieve the body from the water.\nNews about the drowning reached the village and neighbouring villages instantly via social media, and within a very short space of time, a crowd of onlookers flocked to the dam. Many believe the dam has seen far too many drownings, and they blame government for not doing enough to deny people access to the dam.\nPolice spokesperson Brig Hlulani Mashaba confirmed the incident. “We have opened an inquest and appeal to residents not to venture into deep waters, either for fishing or swimming, as there is always the danger of drowning and being attacked by animals such as crocodiles and hippos.”\nFamily spokesperson and cousin of the deceased, Jeremiah Makhado, said he last spoke to Phaswana on the day before he died.\n“He was in such good spirits, and I was shocked to receive the bad news on Sunday. This is very hard on the family. He has left a big void in our hearts.”\nJames Muthathedzwa, who was at the dam to comfort the grieving family, said the dam served no purpose to the community and that it should be fenced off.\n“So many lives have been lost here. It worries us that government is still mining soil from the dam, without even considering the safety of the community. Many children risk their lives swimming in these dangerous waters and the worst is still to come if nothing is done here.”\nPhaswana was buried at Muswodi Tshisimani on Saturday.\nFor more breaking news follow us on Facebook Twitter Instagram or join our WhatsApp group\nAt Caxton, we employ humans to generate daily fresh news, not AI intervention.

He said it was heart-breaking, and he waited for them the whole night, but they never returned. His father had been a fisherman for years. We are just left with many questions about how it happened.”\nAccording to Vhembe police spokesperson WO Vuledzani Dathi, the Makhado police were investigating the incident.\nHe confirmed that the body of the 28-year-old man was found by a resident who had gone to the dam to fish.\n“Mr de Jager, also a fisherman, was removing the fishing nets from the water when he noticed the hand of a human.

The body of a fisherman who drowned in Lake Kanyaboli, Gangu Nyalaji village, in Siaya county has been found.         The deceased was fishing with a friend on Wednesday, when their boat capsized.        The deceased's colleague was able to swim and sought refuge from fishermen who rescued him. However, the deceased drowned before he could be rescued.         The search for the body took two days before it was finally found on Friday morning.         Assistant chief, Enock Otieno, said police took the body to Siaya County Referral Hospital mortuary as the family makes arrangements for his burial.        “Residents in Gangu Nyalaji, together with the local administrators have advised fishermen to wear life jackets when fishing, but many fishermen claim that they know how to swim and do not need the advice,” Kevin Odhiambo, a resident of Gangu said.

They are finding it difficult to jump from one anchored boat to another as there is every danger of slipping into the water and losing their lives.\nIf a fisherman falls into the water at the port, it would be difficult for anyone to rise from the silt that has got accumulated over a long period. Fishermen accuse the administrators of turning a blind eye to the danger that the silt gathered is posing.\nSilt has accumulated up to the third phase of the jetty and it is difficult to anchor boats. In the Baputhota region, there is a substantial amount of silt accumulation that it is difficult to move the boats after emptying the fish in the first and second phase of jetties.  As Malpe is home to a number of big boats at least 3 metres of the vessel is submerged in the water at the port. If 2.5 metres of silt is removed the movement of boats would become easier, fishermen say.  In the last five years, more than 100 people have lost their lives after falling into the water at the port. Once they fall into the water and get under the silt it is difficult for anyone to come back on top. In the last two months itself, 8 of them have lost their lives. Moreover, there are many boats in the jetty that have gone kaput.\nThere is an urgent need for desilting and also devise an alternative system to save the fishermen's lives, according to expert Eshwar Malpe.  \"There have been many accidents happening all the time. Many representations have been made. Now, grants-in-aid has been released. The fishermen's problems must be solved at the earliest,\" said Dayananda K Suvarna, president of Malpe Fishermen Association.  \"The government has given its approval to take up desilting work for which Rs 3 crore has been made available. Desilting work at the channel and three phases of the jetty are likely to be taken up. The process is likely to be completed within two months and work will commence later,\" said Udaya Kumar, assistant executive engineer, ports department.\nFollow Daijiworld News Network on\nTop Stories\nComment on this article\nThomas,  Udupi\nSat, Oct 15 2022\nAll fish trading houses in Malpe are earning in millions from the sale of free fish they obtain from the sea, they should be made to pay for the desilting and upkeep  works of the Malpe seaport,  and that Mr,Yashpal Suvarna who is the President of the Fisherman’s union should be held responsible if he deserves his title  or better to have someone more responsible to take care of all fisherman's woes.\nDisAgree [4] Agree [8]\nReply Report Abuse\nSameer,  Riyadh\nSat, Oct 15 2022\nAsk Raghupathi Bhat.

Indians have a low opinion of themselves and are quick to point out about other people. How about treating minorities properly?  Instead of creating a wedge between people from different communities, how about uniting them? B.J.P has money to buy M.L.A's and ministers and lodge them in huge costly 5-star resorts but no money to fund the desilting and are putting people's lives in danger.

Jovy Baldado Narciso, 31, (pictured) has died after being pulled beneath the water by a huge fish and hitting his head on a rock before drowning      The 5Kg fish (pictured) darted off and pulled Jovy underwater, but refused to come out of a hiding spot, leaving the fisherman unable to return to the water's surface for airThe act of swimming off so quickly caused the rope attached to the harpoon to tangle itself around Jovy's legs and pull him into the water, where he hit his head on a rock. With the 5Kg fish refusing to come out from its hiding place, Jovy struggled to free himself and reach the surface of the water - but was unable to get loose and drowned.          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Kamala Harris' flight from Singapore is delayed by three...    'This is really scary, oh my goodness!' Chilling last words...      Share this article Share   An officer from the Manjuyod Police Station said: 'Worried relatives reported that the man was missing the next morning. We did a search and rescue operation immediately found his body.'The rope was still tied around the man's body while the fish was still under the rock with the harpoon. They were both dead when we arrived.'      A rescue team recovered Jovy's body, which was then transported to hospital before being turned over to his familySuperstitious neighbours believed that the fish that killed the fisherman was 'evil' because Jovy's death was the second drowning incident that happened in the lake after a 14-year-old also died in the area last week.A neighbour said: 'You should be careful in a lake because the creatures have strange behaviour compared to the sea. Just like this evil fish.'The fisherman's body was taken to the hospital before being turned over to devastated relatives for funeral arrangements.\nShare or comment on this article:\nFisherman dies after tumbling into water and hitting his head while harpoon fishing\ne-mail\n172\nshares\nMost watched News videos\nShocking moment man stabs another after brushing shoulders in station\nShocking moment giant fish eats mermaid's face in front of children\nShameless father uses three-month-old baby as a windshield wiper\nKat-fight!

In Thailand, they are facing another threat: working with many risks, ranging from losing body parts to death, without proper protection.\nThis post is also available in Burmese on Dawei Watch.\nA Myanmar migrant fisher, Maung Maung*, still remembers vividly the night he lost his younger brother, Chit Min Thu, to the sea. Maung Maung knows that working as a fisher has many risks, including death. He had always been worried when his younger brother joined him as a fisher in Thailand, especially because his brother did not know how to swim.\nOne night, on July 19, 2023, Maung Maung, Chit Min Thu, and their boss went to the sea in Thailand. Both of the brothers were fishing, while their boss became the boat leader.\nIn the middle of the dark, several waves came and hit their small boat. Then came one big tide that shook their boat. Maung Maung was still able to hold onto the rope in their boat, while Chit Min Thu failed and fell into the water.\n“After he fell off the boat while working, I attempted to save him, but it was already too late,” Maung Maung recounts the younger brother, tears streaming down his face looking at his picture. In a flash, his brother disappeared from his sight. Maung Maung immediately told his boss. His boss helped search for him for 30 minutes as per his duty but was unable to find him. He stopped the search.\n“The boss showed no concern for my little brother, who had fallen into the water. If we had continued the search, we might have been able to find him,” he recalls.\nHis boss continued to work as if nothing had happened. They didn’t continue the search and irresponsibly disembarked on the shore. “That was why I had to let go of my younger brother,” Maung Maung says.\nAfter 12 hours of disappearance, around 1 pm the following day, Chit Min Thu’s dead body was found at another port. However, the boat owner, who had been working for more than 10 years, did not allow him to load his body onto his boat.\nMaung Maung understands that working as migrant fishers means they always need to work as quickly as possible without any protection, including from rescue, police forces, and bay watch forces.\n“This is totally inhumane. The owner didn’t take the corpse immediately and didn’t call the police. He even threatened the person who informed the police, fearing that the case would be filed. He did not allow us to load the corpse to transfer it onto another shore. Thus, I had to tie my late younger brother to my chest, hug the boat body, and make the journey,” Maung Maung recounts.\n“I cradled my late younger brother’s body, crossing the sea for 30 minutes, and brought it back.”\nMyanmar Fishers in Thailand\nMaung Maung and Chit Min Thu were originally from the Phyuu township in the Bago region of Myanmar. Their family consists of nine members, including their parents and seven siblings, three men and four women.\nWhile the women of the family work at garment factories in Yangon, their incomes are not as good as those working in Thailand.\nMaung Maung has been working as a fisherman on a snail hunting boat at the Mekong port in the Samut Prakan district of Thailand for more than 10 years now.\nThe coup in Myanmar made his family more unstable than ever. The military coup started on February 1, 2021, and resulted in political instability and economic stagnation, further exacerbating the loss of job opportunities.\nAccording to a statement from the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, the number of documented Myanmar workers in Thailand increased to 3 million following the coup as of December 2023. An estimated 5 million Myanmar citizens, both documented and undocumented, have sought employment in Thailand since.\nMost of the migrant workers have to take blue-collar jobs that Thai citizens often avoid. Chit Min Thu was one of those people.\nChit Min Thu joined his brother to support their family in 2023. Together, the two brothers earned over 30 lakhs MMK or about 1000 USD per month, which provided full financial support for the family.\nDisregarding the risks to life and safety, many Myanmar nationals are forced to work in the fishery sector, which is widely recognised as one of the most dangerous occupations in the world.\n“As I wanted to continue the traditional work that I did in my village, I chose to work on a boat in Thailand. I am familiar with the work and don’t really find it tiring. It is not difficult for me; I enjoy doing it. When I was in my village, I used to go fishing and set nets to catch fish,” says Maung Maung.\nOver 70,000 individuals are fishers in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar and Cambodia. Approximately 70% of fishers in Thailand come from Myanmar.\nAn illustration of a balance scale where money weighs more than a boat from which a person fell.\nAccording to the International Transport Workers’ Federation—Fishers Rights Network (ITF-FRN) report (2024), “Over 98% of fishers in Thailand are poorly educated male migrant workers from rural Myanmar or Cambodia.”\nIn Thailand, if a person wants to become a fisher, they need to apply for documents such as a work permit, passport or certificate of identity (CI), pink card (Non-Thai ID card), and social security (Prakan Sangkhom) card.\nHowever, according to Miss Phi Saw*, the Human Rights and Development Foundation (HRDF) representative, an organisation that advocates for migrant workers’ rights in Thailand, employers typically keep such documents, and the workers don’t even have a copy. Therefore, most workers are not fully aware of the details of the legal documents that they possess.\nOnly when Port-In-Port-Out (PIPO) officials come to check the documents, before the departure of the boat, do the employers give them to the workers temporarily and take them back upon disembarkation.\nObtaining a work permit, books, and permission to work legally on a one-year visa costs over 30,000 Baht or above 800 USD.\nDespite spending one-third of their pay to work with legal documentation, most fishers do not fully have access to their rights in accordance with the law.\nMany fishers like Chit Min Thu have lost their lives or disappeared at sea. According to the Royal Thai Police, there are at least 306 deaths and disappearances at sea between 2020 and 2022.\nLack of Protection\nAs mentioned earlier, most Myanmar migrant workers work blue-collar jobs since it is harder for them to find alternatives, and even harder for those who are undocumented. They need to earn some money to live with limited work options, including fishing.\nAt a glance, the fishing industry seems promising to the migrant workers. The fishers do not need to spend extra money on accommodation because the employer will provide meals and boats for free. Working together on the boat also removes the necessity for individual expenditures, unlike working on land.\nThese incentives attract many Myanmar workers, including undocumented migrant workers, to choose fishing jobs in Thailand.\nBecause they lack a detailed understanding of workplace hazards and difficulties, most Myanmar people come and work in fishing boats with the hope of getting a lump sum like the factory and construction industries. One of them is U Sein Shin.\nU Sein Shin, 37 years old, is a native of Mrauk-U, Rakhine State in Burma. He has left behind his two parents and one sister there.\nHe was a farm worker in his homeland, but he made a firm decision to work as a fishing boat worker, which he had never done before, to support his family.\nHe worked as a construction worker right after he arrived in Thailand, but earned his income irregularly.\nThus, despite having sea motion sickness, he decided to work as a fisherman, as the 10,000 Baht (around 274 USD) per month salary attracted him. He worked in a fishing boat in the Phanat area of ​​Chumphon District, southern Thailand.\nOnly five days after starting, he experienced a joint dislocation.\n“I went to the boat early in the morning to set the nets. Then, I hit a block and tripped over, resulting in my arm joint becoming disconnected. Perhaps my hand was also sprained and fractured. I lost consciousness and only became aware of what had happened to me when I woke up in the hospital,” he recounts.\nThe mishap happened in early January 2024, as the boat in-charge informed the bay watch force and received first aid assistance.\nHe was sent to the hospital in a timely manner. The employer only allowed him to have one day of medical leave at the hospital. Apart from that, the employer didn’t take any responsibility for it.\nBesides not asking about his medical costs, living expenses, and compensation until one month after the incident, the employer even kept important legal documents such as his passport.\nDue to the worsening of his arm injury, he couldn’t perform well at work anymore. The employer dismissed him.\n“The boss didn’t give me a penny or visit me. I’m still alive because my friends are feeding me,” U Sein Shin says.\nPower Abuse\nIn U Sein Shin’s case, we can see how the boss is able to abuse his power as an employer. Furthermore, until this article was published, his boss still held his social security card. Without the card, U Sein Shin is unable to withdraw medical costs and his medical leave allowance from the compensation fund.\nIn the case of a boat worker falling into the water or any mishap on a fishing boat, they need to activate the signal and inform the bay watch force to seek help.\nAccording to the Aid Alliance Commitee for Myanmar Workers (ACC), when a fisher activates it, they will be rescued in a timely manner and transported to the hospital with emergency services through the Thai military. AAC is an organisation that advocates for Myanmar migrant workers’ rights in Thailand.\nACC representative, Ko Nay Lin Thu, says if they fail to inform the Bay Watch Force to seek help in a timely manner, they may risk their lives, as Chit Min Thu.\n“[Often times], fishing boats do not only operate within their designated location. They go out of the designated boundary. When operating within their designated territory, there’s a rescue force available for their security. However, if they face trouble outside their designated area, they don’t dare to activate the signal for help, fearing being sued,” says Ko Nay Lin Thu.\nHowever, both U Sein Shin, who was injured while working on the boat, and Chit Min Thu, who lost his life, have not yet received any compensation from the social security fund.\nWorkers with social security cards are eligible for free medical treatment at the hospital and to withdraw medical leave allowance. Through this fund, compensation for fisher’s injuries, disabilities, and death will be available. However, it is noted that undocumented fishers are not eligible for this.\nHRDF explains that if the injured person loses a body part, they can withdraw the compensation themselves. In the case of loss of life, the compensation can only be claimed by family members, preferably parents. If workers and family members are unable to collect compensation themselves, they must seek help from Myanmar organisations and cooperate until compensation is received.\nHowever, it is impossible for the workers to withdraw it because, in many cases, the employer keeps the documents, like U Sein Shin’s case. According to the HRDF group, there are even some cases where employers withdrew compensations issued by the Social Security Office by using the documents they kept if the workers injured lost an arm or a leg.\nSystemic Violence\nThailand is well-known for its seafood industry. In 2022, the value of seafood exports from Thailand reached 22 billion Thai Baht (641 million USD) and ranked 6th in the world for seafood. These overseas revenues are largely contributed by over 70,000 migrant fishers working at sea, whose labour has been exploited and unprotected.\nOn the other hand, Thailand is one of the countries that ratified ILO Convention 188 of Work in Fishing in 2019 and issued policies that should protect fisher rights, but exploitation is rife throughout the industry.\nDespite more than 300 fishers missing and losing lives at sea from 2020 to 2022, only about ten asked for help from Myanmar labour organizations, according to the AAC group. AAC’s representative, Ko Nay Lin Thu, emphasized how migrant fishers have faced life-threatening situations on the boat.\n“In 2023 alone, there were incidents of death, accidents, fights, being kicked off the boat, individuals being hit with ropes in the boat and having limbs cut off. There were about 20 such cases as far as the team is aware of,” says Ko Nay Lin Thu.\n“Many cases went unnoticed. Most of them don’t dare to report the case. They didn’t dare to complain because they were afraid, whether it was fear of the employer or fear of losing the job.”\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) urged the Thai government to solve the problems of working conditions.\nLabour violations are worsened by employers’ non-compliance with existing laws and the use of intimidation against migrant fishers. Fishers often do not have employment contracts in their hands, passports, bank books, or documents such as social security cards, and the salary was not transferred through an official bank account.\nAccording to Thai Law, employers must pay the fishers’ monthly salary via bank transfer. However, the ITF-FRN report shows that 99.4 per cent of fishers are not paid monthly by bank transfer.\nMost of the fishers are also not entitled to 30 days off per year under the Seafarers Protection Act 2557. According to HRDF, although the law requires employees to be paid double the regular rate for working on off days, most employers do not comply with this.\nAdditionally, the ITF-FRN report states, “Fishers working on these vessels report that most do not have adequate clean water onboard, lack fully stocked and accessible first aid kits, and are forced to work excessively long hours without adequate rest. These dangerous and unhealthy working conditions not only violate human rights—they violate existing labour law and are clear indicators of forced labour conditions.”\nU Sein Shin recounts how his work was “physically demanding.” Every day, he worked from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Each trip lasted for 20 days without any day off on the boat.\nAAC reported that a big compound where fishers reside in Mahachai is always locked so that fishers cannot go out, and the employer has seized their legal documents.\n“Sometimes, organisations together with local authorities conduct a site visit. Though boat workers don’t dare say anything to us, we see fear on their faces. We have that sense once we see it. Considering the troubles that they have to bear, we did not say things we know to the authorities,” Ko Nay Lin Thu says.\nWorkers are faced with being beaten in the boat, arrested, or dismissed from work and risking deportation.\nFighting Against the System\nAfter facing all of the injustices, both Maung Maung and U Sein Shin decided to fight for their rights. Maung Maung sought help through the AAC organisation and has already filed a complaint at the Social Security Office to receive compensation.\nAt the time of writing, the boss still threatens him to close the case with a small compensation of about 50,000 baht (around 1370 USD) for his brother’s death. Maung Maung ignores the threat and chooses to fight for his brother’s rights instead.\n“We are working to take action against our boss,” says Maung Maung.\nKo Nay Lin Thu said ACC is open to advocating for and helping Myanmar migrant workers who faced incidents or death while working as fishers, such as Maung Maung’s case.\n“Boat cases are said to be rare. Many incidents go unnoticed, especially those that happen on boats,” he says.\nKo Nay Lin Thu, an AAC Alliance representative, suggested that Thailand’s government offices conduct thorough investigations into cases involving migrant fishers. Based on his experience, the success rate is high when the workers want to take it to the legal step.\nTherefore, Ko Nay Lin Thu suggests that when workers face rights violations by employers, they should report those abuses to police forces or workers’ rights protection offices collectively. Workers should especially seek help from Myanmar worker organisations near their places.\nBased on the type of rights abuse, documentation and unpaid labour charges will be further reported to workers’ rights protection offices, and compensation-related matters will be reported to social welfare offices.\nDue to limited knowledge, campaigns and education to increase awareness of migrant fishers’ rights still need to be pushed. HRDF conducts awareness campaigns for 1,000 workers annually in the field, while the Foundation for Education and Development (FED), a foundation that has advocated for migrants’ education and health for years, has been working on education and advocacy for decades.\nNot only from organisations but also from the Thailand government. HRDF and ACC also emphasise the need for the government to promote labour rights awareness in workers’ native languages to ensure effectiveness. Language barriers pose a significant challenge in educating workers, particularly in peripheral areas with limited government outreach.\nHRDF says that it will be handled only if the case is bravely reported to Thai authorities or workers’ organisations.\n“If something happens and a worker does not report it, nothing can be done. Therefore, workers need to report the case. Once family members are informed, they need to file for compensation, as they are all responsible for it. Thai employers rarely feel responsible and pay compensation,” says Miss Phi Saw, an HRDF female officer.\nAs a result, many workers, such as Ko Chit Min Thu and U Sein Shin, have experienced violations of their rights, including failure to receive medical costs and compensation.\nThe mother of Chit Min Thu hopes to receive compensation of over 800,000 Thai Baht for the loss of her son in accordance with the law, and she plans to cooperate with AAC. “I seek a reasonable amount of compensation for this tragedy,” she says.\nShe cried holding Chit Min Thu’s national scrutiny card. “I feel utterly inconsolable. He was my child, a good son who worked to support his parents and siblings. I am overcome with grief. My heart is shattered by this loss.”\n*Pseudonyms were used to protect identities.\nThe story is produced by Dawei Watch with the support from BEBESEA & New Naratif Fellowship Program.\nRecent Posts\nကော့ဖငန်းကျွန်းက မြန်မာစာသင်ကျောင်းကို ထိုင်းရဲဝင်စစ်၊ မြန်မာဆရာလေးဦး ဖမ်းဆီးခံရ\nထားဝယ်-သရက်ချောင်းလမ်းပေါ်ရှိ ‌ရွှေဂူတံတားစစ်ကောင်စီဂိတ်ကို PDF သိမ်းယူ\nပုလော ဆင်ထိုးကြီးရွာတွင် ဥယျာဉ်ခြံအချို့ ရက်ရှည်မီးလောင်နေပြီး မြေမြှုပ်မိုင်းကြောင့် မီးငြှိမ်းရန်ခက်\nဇန်နဝါရီလ ၂၉ရက် တနင်္သာရီနေ့စဉ်သတင်း အစီအစဉ်\nပုလောဒေသခံတစ်ဦး စစ်ကောင်စီတပ် စစ်ကြောရေးတွင် သေဆုံး\nMy Younger Brother …Alive But Suffocated – Elderly suffering the most in Myanmar conflictsRape and sexual assaults by both sides going unpunishedGuardians of Pat-Chan: How river conservations thrived before Myanmar’s crisis\n+95 9876 432 1\ndaweiwatch@gmail.com\nDawei Watch\nDawei Watch သတင်းဌာနကို ၂၀၁၂ ခုနှစ် မေလတွင်ထားဝယ်မြို့ အခြေစိုက် စတင် တည်ထောင်ခဲ့သည်။ Dawei Watch သည် ကနဦးတွင် တစ်နိုင်ငံလုံးခြုံထုတ်ဝေသည့် နေ့စဉ် သတင်းစာများ၊ အပတ်စဉ်များကို အဓိကအားဖြင့် တနင်္သာရီတိုင်းနှင့် မွန်ပြည်နယ်အတွင်းမှ သတင်းများ ဝန်ဆောင်မှုပေးလျက်ရှိသည်။ ယင်းအပြင် ထူးခြားမှုအလိုက် ထိုင်းရောက် မြန်မာ ရွှေ့ပြောင်းလုပ်သားများ သတင်းကိုလည်း တင်ဆက်သည်။\n© Copyright 2025.

The bodies were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.\nThe police said apparently they died of suffocation in a cabin of their boat near Gate No 1, Chashma Goth in Fisheries. However, further investigations were under way, they added.\nPakistan Fisherfolk Forum spokesperson Kamal Shah told Dawn that the fishermen had gone on fishing in a big boat. They usually stay up to one month in the sea for fishing.\nHe said on the boat, the catch and feed were stored in a room. It seemed that some toxic gases accumulated in that room and when one of the fishermen went there he fell unconscious, the spokesperson said.\nFour other fishermen tried to save their colleague, but they also fell unconscious, he said, adding that other fishermen reached Bhindar Island and moved their unconscious colleagues to the jetty from where they were taken to a hospital.\nHe said doctors declared three of them died on arrival, while two others got admitted for treatment and their condition was said to be improving.\nPolice Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the three persons found inside the deck of a fishing boat in the open sea were brought dead at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi at about 4am on Saturday.\nTheir relatives took the bodies without allowing doctors to perform medico-legal formalities.\nPublished in Dawn, September 18th, 2022\nNewspaper\nEmail\nYour Name*Cancel\n0\nRead more\nMotorcyclist drowns in roadside drain\nSit-in over Sanghar killings continues as relatives refuse to bury victims\nCM Murad calls for ‘aggressive and sustained’ efforts to make Sindh polio-free\nSponsored\nRevolutionising reproductive health: Viya launches Viya Telehealth\nOn DawnNews\nڈاکٹر-فارما گٹھ جوڑ: زائد اور غیر ضروری ادویات کے نسخے تجویز کرنے کا بڑھتا رجحان\nملک بھر میں کبوتروں کی ریس کا بڑھتا رجحان اور ‘کبوتربازی’ کے منفی تصورات\nکیا امن معاہدہ کرنے پر ٹرمپ کو نوبیل انعام سے نوازا جائے گا؟\nDawn News English\nWhat Are Rising Sea Levels?\nWhat Is The Paris Agreement?\nTrump’s Trade War With China\nClimate Sensitive Infrastructure Financing\nPECA Amendments: Explained\nWhat Are Floods And Droughts?\nJournalists, Rights Bodies Denounce Peca Changes\nDear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.\nSponsored\nWalee Financial Services’ Hakeem clinches Emerging FinTech Award at SFF 2024\nLatest Stories\nUS-born girl shot dead by father in Quetta over TikTok videos: police\nTrump administration to cancel student visas of pro-Palestinian protesters: White House official\nSHC orders Karachi police to take action against beggars at traffic signals\nFO notes ‘profound concern’ on weapons in Afghanistan as US demands military equipment’s return\nAlibaba releases AI model it claims surpasses DeepSeek-V3\nPM Shehbaz assures US investor delegation of business-friendly environment\nBilal Maqsood’s Pakkay Dost is becoming more inclusive with sign language interpretation\nLahore High Court summons replies from DC, others on Aurat March contempt petition\nReview: Turkish drama Gassal will push you to think about some hard realities of life with a chuckle\nMost Popular\n01\nNAB approaches UAE for Malik Riaz extradition\n02\nTrump freeze on foreign aid felt around the world\n03\nIndia-Taliban budding romance\n04\nCartoon: 29 January, 2025\n05\nPTI no-show\n06\nEx-diplomat Maleeha Lodhi calls for sweeping review of country’s foreign policy\n07\nGovt hints at cheaper industrial power, tax relief for the salaried\n08\n‘A man for all seasons’\n09\n26th Constitutional Amendment based on ‘one letter’: IHC judge Kayani\nMust Read\nIn pictures: Hundreds of millions in Asia celebrate Year of the Snake\nDawn.com | AFP\nEight consecutive public holidays give Chinese residents an opportunity to share meals, attend traditional performances and set off firecrackers.\nAge of deepfakes means internet users must be more alert than ever, experts urge\nAFP\nCaught in a self-created spin, Pakistan hits rock bottom\nIbrahim Farooqi\nDo you care about sustainability?

These emergency services have been in action during the whole weekend Saturday. An emergency signal is being transmitted by VHF to all other vessels sailing through the Gulf of Cadiz, in the hope of one of them spotting the missing boat.\nThis rescue operation was initiated at around 1pm on Saturday 4, after the Guardia Civil received a call informing them of the possible disappearance.

A fisherman died after his shrimp boat capsized. (Source: WALA)By Ariel MalloryPublished: Jun. 3, 2024 at 10:58 PM CDTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInFAIRHOPE, Ala. (WALA) - FOX10 News is following a tragedy on Mobile Bay.A local fisherman was killed when a powerful storm capsized his boat.Captain and shrimper Mike Bishop was found on Saturday.His boat was found flipped over in the water, trapping him inside.A fellow fisherman and friend, Patrick Gormandy, assisted in trying to rescue Bishop and his deckhand Mark Henderson.Bishop and Henderson went out into the bay early Saturday morning for the first day of shrimping season.Bishop’s boat is still waiting to be recovered out of the water, as his boat slip remains empty.Now, a wreath of flowers and a life jacket have been placed where “Old Navy” once docked.Gormandy says he got a call that morning asking if he had heard from Mike.“I got a phone call at 8:45 from a gentleman that has a boat in the marina and asked had I spoke to Mike, and I told him no I haven’t spoke to Mike,” Gormandy said. “The trooper got on the phone with me and said if I send you a picture would you confirm that it’s Mike’s boat? So I did and I knew it was his. I asked for GPS coordinates. We picked up our nets and we took off as fast as we could towards him.”The frantic search for Bishop and his deckhand began.Gormandy says he was more than an hour away from the two but eventually one of his crewmen spotted a hand in the water.It was Henderson, almost unrecognizable, after floating in the water for hours.“When we got about a mile and three quarter away from Mike’s boat we saw something pop up in the wave. My crewman put the binoculars up and we spotted Mr. Henderson,” Gormandy said. “He was very purple, he was cold, shaking, disoriented. We took him in the cabin and put a blanket on him.”Gormandy received the devastating news that Bishop didn’t make it.He returned to Bishop’s boat slip Monday to return the life jacket...overcome with emotion as he remembered his dear friend.“I came here five years ago and he was the first person to talk to me and we’ve been buddies ever since,” Gormandy said emotionally. “He was a good man. Thursday we sat on the deck of my boat. That was the last conversation I had with him.”After spending the last 36 hours out on the water Gormandy says Bishop loved this job, but says people don’t understand how dangerous it is.“I don’t think people realize what it actually takes for us to bring fresh seafood to their table,” he said. “What we do is dangerous. We take it for granted because we go in and out every day but that could have been me. We can get caught in those storms too. If you see a fisherman tell him thank you. If you’re eating fresh gulf seafood it’s a sacrifice.”Henderson is recovering in the hospital.Crews are expected to salvage Bishop’s boat sometime this week.Copyright 2024 WALA.

This untimely death has ignited fear and concern among the families of other Indian fishermen currently detained in Pakistan, many of whom have already completed their sentences. The fisherman, who was arrested by Pakistan's Maritime Security Agency in 2022, had finished serving his sentence by the time of his death. His Indian nationality was communicated to the Pakistani authorities by the Indian government well in advance. As per the Agreement on Consular Access between India and Pakistan, Clause (5) states that, \"Prisoners from one country who have completed their sentences and whose nationality has been confirmed must be released and repatriated to their respective countries within one month.\" Despite this provision, the fisherman was not repatriated as required.\nRead Also\nIndia Asks Pakistan To Expedite Release Of 183 Prisoners During Annual Exchange Of Lists, Seeks...\nThe lack of communication between the prisoners in Pakistan and their families in India has only worsened the sense of anxiety.

Photo: Jeff Ayliffe\nSOUTHERN CAPE NEWS - This past weekend three local fishermen went missing, two at the shoreline south of Thembalethu, and one at Hansmoeskraal, near Pacaltsdorp. On the same weekend, three individuals were rescued from a rip current at Victoria Bay, among them a male teenager who was hospitalised in a stable but serious condition; a man from George drowned at Souwesia beach in Great Brak; and three people, a man and two women, drowned in the Sedgefield lagoon.Two fishermen, ThembalethuNSRI Wilderness station commander Mike Vonk said it appears that three local men were fishing together on Saturday 3 February at the shoreline south of Thembalethu when a wave swept one of the men off the rocks. \"While the two men were attempting to direct their friend to try to swim towards safety, a wave washed another one of the men into the water. \"The third friend had tried to direct both men towards safety but after they were unable to reach safety he had hiked to their vehicles, above the cliffs, and on reaching cellphone reception he raised the alarm before returning to search for his friends who had disappeared in the surf,\" said Vonk.Several emergency services responded, including WC Government Health EMS rescue squad and ambulance, NSRI rescue swimmers, the police, WPDS (Water Policing and Diving Services), George Fire and Rescue Services and the EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter, accompanied by an NSRI ASR (Airborne Sea Rescue) crewman.\"On arrival on the scene an extensive air, sea and shoreline search commenced,\" said Vonk. \"Despite an extensive search there remains no sign of the two missing men.\" Police divers are continuing the search.Fisherman, HansmoeskraalOn Sunday afternoon, 4 February, NSRI Wilderness duty crew were activated by the police following eyewitness reports of a fisherman missing at Hansmoeskraal, near Pacaltsdorp.All the emergency services that responded to the two missing fishermen near Thembalethu again responded to help in this search, except for the EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter and the NSRI ASR (Airborne Sea Rescue) crewman. Although initially activated, they had to stand down due to dense fog on the scene.\"An extensive sea and shoreline search commenced in the search for the local adult male. George Fire and Rescue Services conducted an aerial search using a rescue drone,\" said Vonk. \"Despite the extensive air, sea and shoreline search there remains no sign of the missing man. It appears that while fishing from the shoreline the man was swept into the sea by a wave.\" Police divers are continuing the search.Three rescued, Victoria BayOn Saturday 3 February, three people who were swimming in the surf zone at Victoria Bay apparently moved out of the lifeguards' safer designated area and were swept out further to sea by rip currents.Four lifeguards went into the surf to assist. Shortly before 17:00, the lifeguards alerted NSRI Wilderness duty crew to a drowning in progress.\"The lifeguards rescued two casualties to safety, uninjured,\" said Vonk. \"While swimming towards the third casualty they lost sight of the male teenager in the breaking surf line and sea swells. \"Lifeguards reached the area where they had last seen the teenager and located him as he was being pulled under water. \"The lifeguards, assisted by a local surfer, placed the teenager onto the surfer's surfboard and initiated rescue breaths while rescuing him towards the beach.\"Once ashore three local doctors who happened to be on the beach, NSRI lifeguards, NSRI medics and an ER24 paramedic continued medical treatment and rescue breathing. They were joined by additional NSRI members, emergency services and paramedics who were arriving on the scene.\"With respiratory resuscitation efforts continuing, the teenager was transported to hospital by ER24 ambulance in a critical condition where ongoing medical care was provided by doctors and nurses. \"Following ongoing extensive medical care in hospital, the teenager was stabilised and hospital staff have reported that he is expected to make a full recovery,\" said Vonk.Vonk said NSRI lifeguards, the local surfer and the off-duty doctors who assisted on the scene are commended for their swift response that contributed to saving the teenager's life. \"Thoughts remain with the teenager and his family during the recovery phase.\"Souwesia beach, Great BrakA man from George in his early 30s drowned at Souwesia beach, near De Vette Mossel, on Sunday 4 February.NSRI rescue swimmers, WC Government Health EMS, Mossel Bay Fire and Rescue Services, the police and By Grace ambulance services responded to reports of a drowning in progress.\"While responding to the scene it was confirmed that two men were out of the water,\" said Andre Fraser, NSRI Mossel Bay duty coxswain.\"Paramedics exhausted all efforts to resuscitate a man, in his early 30s, who was sadly declared deceased.\"He said that apparently, a Good Samaritan, a 26-year-old man, went into the surf to help when it seemed that the swimmer was having difficulty in rip currents. \"The Good Samaritan was not injured.\"Fraser said they believe members of the public had assisted them out of the surf. The body of the man was taken into the care of Government Health Forensic Pathology Services. Police have opened an inquest docket. ‘We bring you the latest Garden Route, Hessequa, Karoo news’\nRead more about:\ndrowning\nsouthern cape\nsouwesia\nvictoria bay\nthembalethu\nPosted on: 07:00 Thu, 08 February 2024\nClick here to follow us on WhatsApp\nCOMMUNITY\nMunicipal Notices\nLocal Events\nLocal Sports Gallery\nAbout George\nSEARCH\nOR\nPROFILE\nFind your prefect match now!\nReadyornot1964\nI'm a 61 year old man looking to meet women between the ages of 50 and 60.\nView Profile\nAmo12\nI'm a 52 year old man looking to meet women between the ages of 30 and 60.\nView Profile\nAgapé100\nI'm a 60 year old woman looking to meet men between the ages of 55 and 69.\nView Profile\nSonSkyn_Liefde\nI'm a 33 year old woman looking to meet men between the ages of 32 and 45.\nView Profile\nView more profiles\nI am a:\nSelect Gender\nWoman\nMan\nI am interested in:\nSelect Gender\nWomen\nMen\nMen & Women\nAge range between:\n18 - 60\nSUBMIT\nBack to Top\nMore Group Editors Publications & Online Platforms\nGeorge Herald proudly displays the “FAIR” stamp of the Press Council of South Africa, indicating our commitment to adhere to the Code of Ethics for Print and online media which prescribes that our reportage is truthful, accurate and fair.

In a statement, the PCG said its Sub-Station Araceli continues to search for the missing crew member identified as Edgardo Casuna. PCG District Palawan on Wednesday said fishing vessel master Booths Donasco informed Coast Guard Sub-Station (GCSS) Araceli that Casuna went missing in the vicinity off Barangay Calandagan. According to Donasco, Casuna was swept away by strong sea current. “The master alarmed the vessel to raise alert to all crew members and to halt the fishing-related activities to conduct Search and Rescue (SAR) operation,” the PCG District Palawan said. After hours, the SAR was halted due to rough sea conditions from strong winds. “As of this date, the said crew of FV Yellow Bell is still missing. Moreover, CGSS Araceli will conduct a follow up SAR if weather permits in the area,” the Coast Guard District Palawan said. “Likewise, said Sub-Station advised all watercrafts to be on the lookout for the said missing person and render assistance if sighted and report to the nearest PCG Unit or other government agencies,” the PCG district added. Further investigation into the incident is ongoing, according to PCG Palawan. —LBG, GMA News   Tags: sea incident, Palawan, PCG District Palawan, mission boat crew, news       More Videos       Most Popular               LOADING CONTENT      LOAD MORE ARTICLES    RETRY LOADING                ◀                   All Rights Reserved 2025 © GMA Network Inc.

There was no advisory and sailings are at the captain’s discretion.In a statement, Kingfisher Charters said it is “devastated by the loss of the guests and captain of the Awakin.

One of the fishermen on it, Vijay Bamania, swam to the Madh Island coast and informed us later about the capsizing of his boat.” (Vijay Bate/HT Photo)    While the survivor Vijay Bamania, 35, swam for hours to reach the shore late that night, the body of Vinod Goel, 45, was found at Silver Beach, Versova, on Sunday morning. The search for the third fisherman, Usmani Bhandari, 22, who is suspected to have drowned, is under way.   According to the Versova police, the incident took place on Saturday evening when four fishing boats from Versova village set out into the sea. Each boat had three men. “Sensing a high tide and strong wind, three of the four boats returned to the shore,” said Ganesh Pawar, senior police inspector at Versova police station. “After reaching the shore, they realised that one boat was missing. One of the fishermen on it, Vijay Bamania, swam to the Madh Island coast and informed us later about the capsizing of his boat.” On receiving the alert, the police immediately informed the fire brigade, the Coast Guard and other agencies and launched a search operation for the two missing fishermen. The police said that Bamania had been admitted to hospital, as he was suffering from fatigue. “On Sunday morning, Goel’s body was washed ashore at Silver Beach in Versova,” said Pawar. “We are in the process of registering a case of accidental death and are in the midst of finding out more about the accident from Bamania.” The search operation for Bhandari was conducted by firemen and lifeguards using a ring buoy and ropes along with fishing boats. Indian Navy and helicopters were also deployed to trace the missing fishermen. The search operation was stopped at 1 pm on Sunday on account of high tide and resumed again by 2.30 pm. Santosh Sawant, deputy Chief Fire Officer, Zone 1, told HT, “From 1 pm to 2.30 pm on Sunday, the Mumbai fire brigade was making inquiries, but it was high tide and the police prevented us from carrying out search operations. We then called divers. The Navy was called and a search operation began through helicopters. In the evening we recovered one body.”       Recommended Topics    Share this article       Read this news in brief form              Share Via         Copy Link               Fisherman      Fishing Boat              Catch every big hit, every wicket with Crickit, a one stop destination for Live Scores, Match Stats, Infographics & much more.

He was 59 years old.His nephew Jake Anderson, who appeared with Mavar on the show and previously credited Mavar for helping him through substance abuse struggles, told The New York Times on Saturday that Mavar suffered a heart attack while on a ladder at a boatyard in Naknek, Alaska and fell onto a dry dock.Advertisement\nMavar was pronounced dead at a local hospital.“The passing of Nick Mavar spread through the fishing community like wild fire,” Sig Hansen, captain of the “Northwestern” ship featured on the show, shared Friday. “This is no surprise because of how well known and respected he was by the fishing fleet.”Mavar starred in 98 episodes across 17 seasons of “Deadliest Catch” and appeared in several of its popular spinoffs. He worked aboard the Northwestern and its equipment until 2020, when he left the show after his appendix ruptured while filming.Mavar sued Hansen last year for $1 million for failing to have an adequate plan for ship workers’ medical care, Alaska Public Media reported. Hansen reportedly argued in court last year that the show’s production company and medical provider were to blame for the ship’s COVID-19 protocols, which delayed Mavar’s care.Advertisement\nView this post on Instagram            A post shared by Nick Mavar (@mavarnick360) The fisherman was injured while filming an episode in 2011, when a storm loosened a large hook that hit Mavar in the face, and broke his nose. That incident, as well the appendix scare, were both documented on the show.His death comes nearly four years after 33-year-old “Deadliest Catch” deckhand Nick McGlashan died of a reported drug overdose — and days after Captain “Wild” Bill Wichrowski shared his prostate cancer diagnosis in a preview of the show’s current season.Advertisement\nMavar spent his final years golfing and captaining his own salmon boat in Bristol Bay. He is survived by his wife, father, two children from a previous marriage, a stepdaughter and three siblings. His nephew remembers him as “a fisherman through and through.”“[T]he camera was something that was just there,” Anderson told the Times.Related obituarydeadliest catchRussell Crowe Mocks 'Madame Web' Star For Her Disappointment With Comic Book MoviesRob Schneider Is Getting Roasted For Saying 'Asshole' Will Smith Should've Been ArrestedGoldie Hawn Says She And Kurt Russell Have Had 2 Home Invasions Since 2020 Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement\nFrom Our Partner\nFrom Our Partner\nHuffPost Shopping'sBest FindsNewsletter Sign UpEntertainmentDon't miss a beat.

A prayer service was held for the man in Grindavík on Sunday.\nMost extensive search effort in years\nThe search continues for a fisherman who fell overboard just outside Faxaflói Bay on Friday afternoon. The man, a Grindavík resident and father of three, was a fisherman on the longline fishing boat Sighvatur GK-57, which is owned and operated by the Grindavík-based fishing company Vísir hf. The police have interviewed the ship’s captain and have deemed the incident a “tragic accident,” Vísir reports.\nRead More: A Brief History of Iceland’s Maritime Safety and Survival Training Centre\nThe search effort is the most extensive of its kind in years, Guðmundur Birkir Agnarsson, Director of Operations with the Icelandic Coast Guard, told the hosts of the radio programme Morgunútvarpið yesterday morning. On Saturday, fifteen boats participated in the search – among them the patrol ship Þór – in addition to two helicopters.\nGiven how many days have passed since the man fell into the sea, the Coast Guard has expanded the search area from 10 x 10 nautical miles to 18 x 18 nautical miles. Ásgeir Erlendsson, Public Relations Officer for the Icelandic Coast Guard, told Mbl.is yesterday that search conditions have been relatively good, despite not having found the man.\nPrayer service in Grindavík\nA prayer service was held for the fisherman in Grindavík on Sunday. Fannar Jónsson, Mayor of Grindavík, told Vísir that the community was ‘deeply saddened’ and that all they could do was wait.\nAccording to Fannar, the prayer service was well attended, for an event such as this has an outsized effect on such a small community:\n“Yes, it’s very hard. You have a big family and friends … the crew, the company, and the sailor’s family, they’re all hurting. But there’s a solidarity and a unity among the community, whenever something like this happens.”\nCoast Guard, Fannar Jónsson, Faxaflói, fisherman, Grindavík, missing, search effort, Sighvatur GK-57, Vísir\nSign up for our weekly newsletter\nGet news from Iceland, photos, and in-depth stories delivered to your inbox every week!\nEmail\nSign up\nSubscribe to Iceland Review\nIn-depth stories and high-quality photography showcasing life in Iceland!\nSubscribe\nRelated News\nNews\nPtarmigan Take Over Grindavík\nNews\nFamous Cat Missing\nNature\nWater Cannons Used to Cool Lava Near Blue Lagoon, Infrastructure\nFrom the Travel Desk\nPartnerships\nRaise the anchor with Viggson Sailing in Iceland\nPlaces\nA Guide to Gullfoss: Iceland’s Most Iconic Waterfall\nPlaces\nThe Lava Tunnel in South Iceland\nLatest news\nIceland to Compete in First Semi-Final Night at Eurovision 2025Meteorologist Warns Of Weather Chaos This WeekendNBA Star Jeremy Pargo To Play For GrindavíkDrifting Boat Rescued Off Snæfellsnes PeninsulaSperm Whale Beaches on Northwest Shore\nIceland Review – Helping you discover since 1963\nNews\nMagazine\nAsk Iceland Review\nIn Focus\nTravel Tips & Info\nBook Tours\nNews\nMagazine\nAsk Iceland Review\nIn Focus\nTravel Tips & Info\nBook Tours\nAbout Us\nWork with Us\nPrivacy Policy\nOur History\nSign Up For Our Newsletter\nAbout Us\nWork with Us\nPrivacy Policy\nOur History\nSign Up For Our Newsletter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYoutube\n© 2024 - Iceland Review ehf.

They are among the poorest of this poor country. They are also engaged in one of the most hazardous occupations. It is they who brace themselves for the deadliest storms and tidal bores and as a result hundreds die every year in the Bay or in the turbulent Padma while catching fish.\nBrief news items routinely report a large number of fishermen as missing and there is hardly any follow-up story on their ultimate fate. Another menace they have to live with is attack and looting by Myanmar pirates as well as their Navy. On Wednesday, a fisherman was killed and two others received gunshot wounds after Myanmar Navy chased and opened fire at six Bangladeshi fishing trawlers near Saint Martin’s Island in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe government fails to take up the matter with the Myanmar government. As if fishermen’s lives are the most expendable in the country. This indifference would be more inexcusable when set against their massive contribution to the life and economy of the country. According to the fisheries department, there are an estimated 1.8-million registered fishermen in Bangladesh. They are mostly self-employed or employed by some other fishermen.\nSixty-seven per cent of the people’s animal protein intake, 2.43 per cent of national GDP and 22.14 per cent of the agricultural GDP and 1.05 per cent of foreign exchange earnings come from the fishery sector. And the credit for the sector’s significant contribution to economy primarily goes to the fishermen. But the politics of change or economics of change pass them by. One does not even hear of the NGOs taking up any programme for development of this luckless lot. Moreover, due to their economic vulnerability, many in society tend to look down upon them.\nThey rarely receive the same recognition as farmers and other rural communities. Apparently, their connection with those in power is too weak to advocate for their needs effectively. Annually, the fishermen face a 147-day fishing ban, which includes a 22-day ban on catching hilsa in October, a 60-day ban on catching jatka (hilsa fry) during March and April, and a 65-day ban from May 20 to July 23.\nThese bans are essential for the breeding and conservation of marine life and ensuring sustainable fisheries. In the meantime, how do the fishermen survive and feed their families? When these restrictions are enforced, the fishing community is pushed to the brink of survival, as the government-provided food assistance during these periods is inadequate.\nAs a 22-day ban on catching Hilsa began from Saturday (October 12) midnight, fishermen in the coastal region once again are voicing concern about their impending economic hardship. There is a call for increased food assistance and cash aid during the ban, access to life-saving equipment, deep-sea weather signal broadcasting, and loans on easy term, just to weather the storm. Against this bleak backdrop, the government’s plan to introduce insurance coverage for fishermen is a welcome development.\nThe Financial Institutions Division (FID) has been tasked with developing a project to implement the insurance scheme through the state-run Jiban Bima Corporation (JBC). If effectively implemented, this coverage would provide a vital safety net for fishermen and their families in cases of accidents, illness, or death.\nWithout such protection, these families are left financially vulnerable when disaster strikes, sinking them further into poverty. Offering insurance would also help mitigate the long-term economic hardship of the fishing communities entirely dependent on fishing for survival. As a fish-loving nation it is essential that fishermen are given every consideration and protection.\nURL:  https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/opinions/fishermen-in-deepening-misery\nICSF\nInternational Collective  in Support of Fishworkers\nNews\nYemaya Newsletter\nSAMUDRA Report\nOUR WORK\nRight to Resources\nGender in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nDisasters and Climate Change\nDecent Work\nFisheries Trade\nAquaculture\nBiodiversity\nAbout ICSF\nSSF Guidelines\nICSF Campaigns\nResources\nICSF Archives\nSign-up for News Alerts\n×\nName*\nEmail*\nPlease tell us about your work  This helps us network better\nNature of Work\nCountry*\nAfghanistan\nAfghanisthan\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerica\nAmerican Samoa\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands/India\nAndaman Nicobar Islands/India\nAndhra Pradesh\nAndhra Pradesh/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Odisha/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu/Puducherry\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArctic Ocean\nArgentina\nArunachal Pradesh/India\nASEAN\nAsia\nAssam/India\nAustralia\nAustralia.

The government’s Marine Fisheries Department states that Bangladesh is now the fifth largest marine fishing country in the world in terms of tonnage caught. However, commercial marine fishing is considered to be one of the most hazardous occupations worldwide. Is anything known about the health and safety status of the fishermen of the Bay of Bengal? How many of the fishermen get killed or maimed on the job while supplying fish protein for the country’s people?\nEvent #1: December 7, 2021– Due to the rough weather, a trawler carrying 21 fishermen capsized in the Bay of Bengal near Barguna’s Patharghata area, and 20 fishermen went missing.\nEvent #2: March 28, 2022– Indian Coast Guard rescued 19 fishermen who were deserted in Indian waters in the Bay of Bengal. The Bangladeshi fishermen, who started from Cox’s Bazar were marooned as their wooden trawler developed a mechanical problem. The trawler had been floating for more than 20 days. The exhausted fishermen had nothing to eat. They were provided with first aid, food, and water by the Indian Coast Guard.\nEvent #3: February 6, 2022– A total of 144 fishermen were rescued after the drowning of 11 trawlers in the Bay of Bengal. The bodies of the two dead were handed over to their families. They were rescued from Pathorghata in Barguna by the Fishermen’s Trawler Owners’ Association and the Dublarchor Fisherman Group.\nEvent #4: November 29, 2021– Bangladesh Navy rescued 14 fishermen alive from a fishing boat that had been floating for eight days in the Bay of Bengal, 140 km away from Cox’s Bazar.\nEvent #5: March 28, 2022– Some seven fishing trawlers went missing in the Bay of Bengal due to rough weather. At least seven fishermen were considered missing, according to the Bangladesh Coast Guard. The trawlers disappeared in the Bhashanchar route after starting from Banshkhali Upazila of Chattogram.\nAround 17 million people (with about 1.5 million women) are engaged in fishing, fish farming, fish handling, and processing for their livelihood in Bangladesh. The fisheries sector contributes 4 per cent to the GDP while the agricultural sector contributes around 15 per cent to the GDP. Around 4.5 million tonnes of fish were harvested in 2017-18, of which 655,000 tonnes came from the Bay of Bengal, almost 16 per cent of the total production. Bangladesh earned taka 4,310 crores from exporting almost 70.95 thousand tonnes of fish, shrimp, and other fisheries or fishery products during 2019-20 and this is 1.40 per cent of the total national export earnings. The country has seen a rise in fish capture, fish culture, and marine fish production, and in terms of distribution, inland capture accounts for 28 per cent,  inland culture 57 per cent, while the rest is marine capture.\nIt is difficult to count how many people rely exclusively on fisheries or related activities in Bangladesh but a great portion is involved in subsistence fisheries on its flood plains. Fisheries and related activities support more than 7 per cent of the country’s population. The number of fishermen increases dramatically between June to October each year because of the seasonal patterns of fish harvesting. In terms of marine fishing, at present, there are 255 registered trawlers out of which 236 are used for fishing only. Of those, around 35 are shrimp trawlers, 52 bottom trawlers, 68 midwater transformed trawlers, 53 midwater trawlers, and 28 trial trip bottom trawlers. In addition, there are 67,669 mechanised and non-mechanized boats that are engaged in fishing. Currently, more than 600,000 people are engaged in shrimp farming activities alone.\nSeveral studies conducted in the United States (US) confirmed that commercial fishing is still one of the most dangerous occupations. During 1992-2008, an average of 58 reported deaths occurred (128 deaths per 100,000 workers) annually among commercial fishermen, compared with 5,894 deaths (four per 100,000 workers) in all other sectors in the US. To assess the hazards and risk factors, US CDC collected and analysed fatality data during 2000-2009: out of 504 fatalities, most (52 per cent) occurred following a vessel disaster (e.g., sinking, capsizing, or other events when the crew had to abandon ship) or a fall overboard (31 per cent).\nSome risk factors and causes identified for marine fishing by research studies include– 1) fishing vessels often manned by fewer individuals, 2) working with heavy-duty equipment, 3) working in unsafe environments, 4) working for very long hours, 5) economic pressures forcing inappropriately geared vessels to operate, 6) vessels not fit, not allowed or not safe going further out in sea than permitted. Deaths among the marine fishermen resulted from a wide variety of situations involving 1) vessel loss, 2) falls overboard, 3) fire and explosions, 4) cable entanglements, and 5) gas exposure. In many cases, the real causes or circumstances remained unknown as autopsies are difficult for drowning or hypothermia cases and decomposition and animal predation of the dead bodies made the investigation obscured.\nThings must be much worse in Bangladesh for its commercial marine fishermen. Research findings will help with the development of effective prevention measures and practices through the delivery of appropriate safety awareness training. Studying the marine fishermen is important to characterise potential influences on or barriers to safety to design interventions that can alter safety practices and behaviours. The Bangladesh Coast Guard (USCG) can conduct periodic surveys on fishing hazards.\nAll training programmes must target increasing the awareness among fishermen about the severe occupational risks inherent in their work. Fishing community trust and collaborative partnerships are essential to the success of such initiatives. Simple, yet appropriate training and awareness measures must incorporate visual and written safety messages that can favourably influence attitudes, beliefs, and behavioural intent related to high priority risk factors as identified by fishermen. Opportunities exist and strategies are needed for improving the safety of fishermen in the Bay of Bengal.\nURL: https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/safety-of-fishermen-in-the-bay-of-bengal-1649258919\nICSF\nInternational Collective  in Support of Fishworkers\nNews\nYemaya Newsletter\nSAMUDRA Report\nOUR WORK\nRight to Resources\nGender in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nDisasters and Climate Change\nDecent Work\nFisheries Trade\nAquaculture\nBiodiversity\nAbout ICSF\nSSF Guidelines\nICSF Campaigns\nResources\nICSF Archives\nSign-up for News Alerts\n×\nName*\nEmail*\nPlease tell us about your work  This helps us network better\nNature of Work\nCountry*\nAfghanistan\nAfghanisthan\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerica\nAmerican Samoa\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands/India\nAndaman Nicobar Islands/India\nAndhra Pradesh\nAndhra Pradesh/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Odisha/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu/Puducherry\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArctic Ocean\nArgentina\nArunachal Pradesh/India\nASEAN\nAsia\nAssam/India\nAustralia\nAustralia.

In reply to an application filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, the Indian High Commission in Islamabad has said that a total 24 Indian fishermen died in Pakistan jails between January 2014 and December 2023.\nThe RTI application was filed by a Mumbai-based journalist and peace activist, Jatin Desai, who has been working for the welfare of fishermen. Desai, who has also served as general secretary of the Indian chapter of the India-Pakistan People’s Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD), said with two more deaths this year, so far 26 fishermen have died in about 10 years.\n“On March 17 this year, Vinod Laxman Kol, a fisherman from Maharashtra’s Palghar died in a Pakistan jail and his mortal remains were handed over to his family members only on May 1. Suresh Nathu Solanki, a fisherman hailing from Gir Somnath district of Gujarat died in a Pakistan jail on September 5,” Desai told The Indian Express. The activist had also sought names of fishermen who died in Pakistan jails, date of their deaths and date on which their mortal remains were repatriated to India. However, the high commissioner declined to share that information. “Information sought is exempt under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act 2005,” Dinesh Singh Rawat, second secretary and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, stated in his reply dated September 26. Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act provides for exemption from disclosure of information which “relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.”\nAdvertisement\nIndia and Pakistan have disputes over the alignment of the notional International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) at the Arabian Sea off Kutch coast in Gujarat. Therefore, Pakistan Marine Security Agency (PMSA) apprehends a few hundred fishermen every year for allegedly crossing over to the Pakistan side of the IMBL. Similarly, every year, a few dozen Pakistani fishermen are arrested by the Indian authorities for allegedly violating territorial waters of India. Of late, it has been observed that it takes many weeks for mortal remains of fishermen to be repatriated from Pakistan. “In the case of the Gujarat fisherman who died in September, his nationality had already been verified. Yet his body has not been handed over to his family members a month after his death. This is a violation of human rights,” said Desai.\nA senior fisheries officer in state government said: “The fisherman’s family reached out to us a few days ago, seeking information about his reported death in Pakistan jail. However, we have received no formal communication from the government of India.”\nURL: https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/26-indian-fishermen-died-in-pak-custody-in-last-10-years-rti-9604420/\nICSF\nInternational Collective  in Support of Fishworkers\nNews\nYemaya Newsletter\nSAMUDRA Report\nOUR WORK\nRight to Resources\nGender in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nDisasters and Climate Change\nDecent Work\nFisheries Trade\nAquaculture\nBiodiversity\nAbout ICSF\nSSF Guidelines\nICSF Campaigns\nResources\nICSF Archives\nSign-up for News Alerts\n×\nName*\nEmail*\nPlease tell us about your work  This helps us network better\nNature of Work\nCountry*\nAfghanistan\nAfghanisthan\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerica\nAmerican Samoa\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands/India\nAndaman Nicobar Islands/India\nAndhra Pradesh\nAndhra Pradesh/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Odisha/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu/Puducherry\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArctic Ocean\nArgentina\nArunachal Pradesh/India\nASEAN\nAsia\nAssam/India\nAustralia\nAustralia.

The disease spread around the boat and its attached rafts and by 11 October 40 fishermen were suffering from diarrhoea.\nThe boat docked at Ahsin Village and  those suffering from severe symptoms were taken for further treatment to Ye Township People’s Hospital, where they are being monitored and treated under quarantine.\nFor some of those suffering from diarrhoea the symptoms seem to clear up before recurring a few days later. So far, the only cases were contracted whilst the sufferers were at sea and there has been no transmission of diarrhoea reported in Ahsin Village.\nAlso, in the last week of September, a fisherman who docked in Ahsin Village died from diarrhoea. The use of seawater for washing and toilets; and eating improperly cleaned or cooked seafood like sea snails and fish, may have contributed to the spread of diarrhoea amongst the fishermen, according to locals.\nIn mid-September an outbreak of diarrhoea amongst fishermen in the waters off the coast of Kyaikkhami Town in Thanbyuzayat Township, Mon State, killed six fishermen and infected about another 150.\nURL: https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/fishermen-suffering-diarrhoea-ye-township-coast\nICSF\nInternational Collective  in Support of Fishworkers\nNews\nYemaya Newsletter\nSAMUDRA Report\nOUR WORK\nRight to Resources\nGender in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nDisasters and Climate Change\nDecent Work\nFisheries Trade\nAquaculture\nBiodiversity\nAbout ICSF\nSSF Guidelines\nICSF Campaigns\nResources\nICSF Archives\nSign-up for News Alerts\n×\nName*\nEmail*\nPlease tell us about your work  This helps us network better\nNature of Work\nCountry*\nAfghanistan\nAfghanisthan\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerica\nAmerican Samoa\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands/India\nAndaman Nicobar Islands/India\nAndhra Pradesh\nAndhra Pradesh/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Odisha/India\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu/Puducherry\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArctic Ocean\nArgentina\nArunachal Pradesh/India\nASEAN\nAsia\nAssam/India\nAustralia\nAustralia.

However, while on the lake, all the suspects reportedely jumped into the Lake Albert waters fearing to be detained.\nJakisa managed to swim up to the shores, FPU said, while the rest of his colleagues are reported to have drowned.\nMoses Onen, the LCI Chairperson for Mbegu B landing site said that after a search was conducted on the lake by local fishermen, the body of Onen was found floating on the lake near Mbegu landing site on Thursday while the two bodies are still missing.\nJulius Hakiza, the Albertine Region Police spokesperson says that the marine police and fishermen have teamed up to search for the two remaining missing bodies.\nAccording to Hakiza, they have started investigating the actions of the FPU operatives.\nIn November 2021, a fisherman died in Lake Albert in Hoima district after seeing an approaching crew of Fisheries Protection Unit -FPU personnel.   The deceased was only identified as Owonda, attached to Kijangi landing site in Tonya parish Buseruka sub-county in Hoima district.\nOn the fateful day, the deceased together with three other fishermen whose names were not established had gone fishing when they saw the FPU operatives who accused them of using illegal fishing gear.\nAfter seeing the FPU operatives challenging them, Owonda jumped into the lake and died on the spot.\nIn 2017, President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni directed Uganda Peoples Defense Forces-UPDF soldiers to deploy on all the lakes in the country to combat illegal fishing practices to protect the fish resources that were under threat of depletion.\nHowever, the Fisheries Protection Unit-FPU has since been under the spotlight for torturing and extorting money from fishermen.\nThe fishermen claim that instead of prosecuting them in courts of law, the soldiers have resorted to battering them in front of their family members and friends, which deprives them of their dignity but the FPU has always denied the allegations leveled against them by the fishermen.\n****\nURN\nShare on: WhatsApp\nfishermen FPU Lake Albert 2023-11-10\nThe Independent\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGoogle +\nLinkedIn\nTags fishermen FPU Lake Albert\nLoading...\nRelated Articles\nInternal Security Organization boss Oluka dead\nJanuary 29, 2025\nParliament committee names man who has spent 28 years in Luzira Prison without trial\nJanuary 29, 2025\nOpposition unhappy with EC over voter update exercise\nJanuary 29, 2025\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

In the absence of communication, they are always worried about their near and dear ones who are in Pakistan's jails.”“India and Pakistan must allow a team of doctors to visit the other country to check on their own prisoners.

The incident occurred on the Corentyne River just off Port Nickerie in the Dutch-speaking territory.\nThree members of the crew reportedly used the icebox to float. However, Jaipaul was not with them, as he reportedly disappeared during the dark hours in the rough waters.\nDuring a search, the $11 million boat was discovered but it was completely wrecked. “We can’t do nothing, I tell them search for the man because that is material things so fishing work a go, we na get insurance or nothing,” Ramdharry said.\nMeanwhile, on Friday, the man’s body washed ashore. It was positively identified by the now-dead man’s brother.

missing fisherman last seen on Stump Lake near Merritt\nThe BC RCMP’s Underwater Recovery Team has been called in to help with the search for two men who were last seen fishing on Stump Lake. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Merritt RCMP were notified that the two Lower Mainland men were missing.\nA release issued on Wednesday says the two men had been last seen by friends, fishing late into the evening in a small aluminum boat. When they didn’t return after dark, friends began to search for them but were unsuccessful and eventually called police. The Kamloops Search and Rescue team was also notified and joined in the search for the two men, alongside Police Dog Services. An extensive ground, water and air search was conducted.  Debris belonging to the missing fisherman was found floating near the North end of the lake but neither the fishermen, nor their boat have been located. \"We are not releasing the names of the missing fishermen at this time,” says S/Sgt. Josh Roda, detachment commander with the Merritt RCMP.  \"We want to give the families privacy while they try to comprehend what took place.” Search efforts will continue at the lake in the coming days. If you are recreating in the Stump Lake area and find debris that you believe may be associated with the missing fishermen, contact the Merritt RCMP at (250) 378-4262.\nIf you get value from KelownaNow and believe local independent media is important to our community we ask that you please consider subscribing to our daily newsletter.\nEmail Address *\nIf you appreciate what we do, we ask that you consider supporting our local independent news platform.\nSend your comments, news tips, typos, letter to the editor, photos and videos to news@kelownanow.com.\nUpdating Stories\n0°\nWed2℃Thu0℃Fri3℃Sat3℃Sun2℃Mon-5℃\nRecent Livestream\nTop Stories\nUPDATE: Bennett Bridge reopens to traffic after bomb scare forces 10-hour closure\nMissing snowboarder, 21, found dead at BC resort\nDowntown Kelowna’s newest ramen spot was born in Japan\nTrump bump: US citizenship renunciation inquiries surge in Canada, lawyers say\n3 officers injured during arrest of ‘distraught man’ at Kelowna McDonald's\nCanadian teen brain-injured in Caribbean bar attack back home but missing skull piece\nCanada stops letting cross-border hikers enter BC via Pacific Crest Trail\nEby says US tariff could hit harder than 2008 recession, vows pandemic-style relief\nFollow Us\nPrivacy Policy",

Head of Cilacap Search and Rescue Office, Adah Sudarsa, stated that the ship is believed to be unable to withstand the force of pulling the net, causing it to lose balance to the point of capsizing and being carried away by the current to the shore.An accident occurred on Wednesday at 07.30 AM WIB. There were 9 people on board. Six of them survived, two died, and one is still missing and being searched for by the Joint SAR Team.Also read: High Waves Make Fishermen's Search Difficult in CilacapARSIP BASARNAS CILACAPResidents and a joint SAR team hauled a capsized fishing boat at Wagir Indah Beach, Adipala, Cilacap, Central Java, on Wednesday (18/10/2023).The identities of the survivors are Farid (31), Arjun (22), Tusmin (60), and Dul Rohim (55). The four of them are residents of Brebes. There are also Roni (32) and Musa (65) from Cilacap. The deceased victims are named Slamet (62) and Alfin Rastoni B Darmo (60) from Brebes. \"Meanwhile, one person who is still missing is named Edi Suwaryo (55) from Brebes,\" said Adah.According to Adah, currently the Joint SAR Team has combed the surface of the water using LCR (landing craft rubber) around the location of the incident and pulled the ship's net. It is feared that the victim was caught in the net.Apart from that, the Joint SAR Team also combed the land area around the incident location. \"We have sent a rescue team to the location of the incident to look for one crew member, complete with SAR equipment in the water,\" he said.Also read: 9 Days Missing, Cilacap Fisherman Found DeadSaeful Anwar from the Public Relations department of Basarnas Cilacap stated that, from the information gathered by his team, the fishermen did not wear safety jackets or life rafts when they were at sea. This incident adds to the list of accidents caused by not using safety equipment while at sea.Previously, a jellyfish hunter fisherman at Bunton Beach, Cilacap, was found dead after being submerged for nine days. On Monday (16/10/2023), Basarnas SAR Office in Cilacap received information from the SAR potential regarding the discovery of a corpse in the waters of Lengkong, Cilacap.ARSIP BASARNAS CILACAPThe Joint SAR Team is searching for a jellyfish hunter who reportedly went missing at Bunton Beach, Cilacap, Central Java, on Wednesday (11/10/2023).After undergoing forensic tests by authorized personnel, the body was identified as Marto Miardi (61) from Mertasinga, North Cilacap District, according to Adah. It is known that on Sunday (10/8/2023), the victim went to sea to search for jellyfish. However, on Monday (10/9/2023) morning, only a broken boat belonging to a fisherman without an engine was found around Bunton Beach.As reported previously (Kompas.id, 11/10/2023), according to data from Basarnas Cilacap, there were 41 incidents handled by Basarnas Cilacap during January-September 2023.A total of 41 incidents consisted of 5 ship accidents, 1 natural disaster, 33 events endangering human lives, as well as 2 accidents requiring special handling. Out of this number, there were 144 victims with details of 98 survivors, 31 deaths, and 15 people declared missing.Sometimes you don't even care about your own safety.Compared to 2022, there were 66 incidents with a total of 54 fatalities, 8 missing persons, and 318 survivors. Meanwhile, in 2021, there were 55 incidents with 46 survivors, 43 fatalities, and 17 missing persons.The Chairman of the Indonesian Fishermen Association in Cilacap Regency, Sarjono, once mentioned that traditional fishermen still ignore their own safety as they do not always wear life jackets.\"We have been instructed many times that when going to sea, we must wear a safety jacket for protection. Sometimes you don't even pay attention to your own safety, it's said to be complicated, even though it's important. \"Even if you can't swim, if you get into the sea, you'll definitely float,\" said Sarjono (Kompas.id 26/7/2023).

Separate incident: Missing man's body found in flooded river. Fishing community's safety concerns raised.Palghar: Missing fisherman's dead body found in Dahanu coastIn a tragic incident, the lifeless body of a fisherman who had drowned at sea was discovered on the coast of Dahanu on July 27. The fishermen, Prakash Patil (age 32) and Bhupendra Ambhire (age 36), were on a fishing trip in a non-mechanised small boat when it capsized due to high waves on July 26. Prakash managed to swim to the shore, but Bhupendra got entangled in fishing nets, and his body was recovered the following day.Despite a fishing ban in place for mechanised boats from June 1 to July 31, impoverished fishermen continue to risk their livelihoods by using non-mechanised boats for short-distance fishing. The hand-to-mouth economic circumstances of fisherfolk compel them to take such risks.In a separate incident, the body of Vijay Patkar, reported missing from Musalpada, Vikramgad, was found on the banks of the flooded Vagarje River in Vikramgad Taluka. Vijay had been for work at Kasa in Dahanu taluka on July 27, and he was suspected to have slipped in the flooded river while returning from work. His lifeless body was discovered on the river banks when the water levels receded on Friday.These tragic events highlight the challenges faced by the fishing community, who bravely venture out to earn their livelihoods despite the inherent risks involved in their occupation. Authorities must address the safety concerns of fishermen and devise measures to safeguard their lives while they continue their essential work.Open in appShare:Tags :Maharashtra NewsMumbai NewsPalgharSectionNationalInternationalEntertainmentPhotosVideosBusinessSportsTechnologyLifestyleHealthPoliticsAbout UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy PolicyContact UsSitemapTerms of UseStatutory provisions on reporting ( sexual offences )Code of ethics for digital news websitesCSR PolicyOUR NETWORKlokmat.comlokmatnews.inepaper.lokmat.comdeepotsav.lokmat.comlokmat.netFOLLOW US : CityCricketLatestPhotosEntertainmentCopyright ©2025 Lokmat Media Pvt LtdPresident Murmu to attend Gauhati HC's 75th year celebrations on April 7Ajit Pawar: Modi's charisma, not degree, won 2014 electionsHopscotch ties up with N7 - The Nitrogen Platform to enhance its website &amp; mitigate DDoS attacksShiv Sena rift turns violent: Woman beaten by rival faction activistsMumbai: Few cracks were found on surface of Gateway of India during inspectionBridging Borders: An NRI Family's homecoming with their culturally-inspired productsLandmark Transaction worth 26.5 crores in AlibaughMP: Government increases the grant amount for gallantry awards recipientsWorld Bank cuts India's GDP forecast for 2023-24 by 30 bpsHooghly: BJP claim stage for Bengal chief's dharna razed",

It involved the fishing vessels “Ponta de Peça” and “Djesone”, which collided in the navigation channel between the islands of São Vicente and Santo Antão, in the north of the archipelago, causing the death of a crew member, aged 33.\nThe two vessels were from the island of Santo Antão, and the accident resulted in “considerable damage and a fatal victim, a fisherman on board the vessel ‘Djesone’, and for that reason is classified as a very serious accident and, consequently, of mandatory investigation by the national investigation authority,” the institute said.\n“Following this, IPIAAM issued safety recommendations to institutions with responsibilities in the matter to ensure compliance with procedures, prevent the occurrence of accidents in the fisheries sector and ultimately promote operational safety, counting for this purpose with the participation and involvement of all ‘stakeholders’,” adds the note on the conclusions of the investigation.\nTop Stories\nChina January 30, 2025\nChinese satellite enterprises provide expanded, improved global services\nChina January 30, 2025\nTrade-in program boosts China’s Spring Festival shopping season\nInternational January 30, 2025\nAngola: Three more die in cholera outbreak, bringing total to 48\nInternational January 30, 2025\nEU pledges 3 billion euros for Jordan in new ‘strategic’ partnership\nFinance January 30, 2025\nGermany slashes 2025 growth forecast to 0.3 percent\nInternational January 29, 2025\nFirst Gaza aid ship arrives at Egypt’s El-Arish port since ceasefire\nInternational January 29, 2025\nPentagon strips Trump foe Milley of security detail\nFinance January 29, 2025\nFirst MOP-denominated public fund available for GBA investors\nMacau January 29, 2025\nMGTO targets recovery of overseas tourist numbers to 2019 levels\nMacau January 29, 2025\nSpecial Report – New consumer habits came to stay\nMacau January 29, 2025\nLocal digital installation wins Gold Award at Glow Shenzhen Light Art Festival\nInternational January 29, 2025\n‘Urgent action’ needed to protect UK fish species, court hears\nInternational January 29, 2025\nSyria demands Israel pullout from Golan: state media\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\nChinese satellite enterprises provide expanded, improved global services\nJanuary 30, 2025\nChinese space companies have been expanding their satellite services, including communication, navigation and remote sensing,...\nTrade-in program boosts China’s Spring Festival shopping season\nJanuary 30, 2025\nChina's consumer goods trade-in program remained highly popular at the start of the year,...\nAngola: Three more die in cholera outbreak, bringing total to 48\nJanuary 30, 2025\nThe number of cholera cases in Angola has risen to 1,216, with 63 more patients...\nEU pledges 3 billion euros for Jordan in new ‘strategic’ partnership\nJanuary 30, 2025\nThe European Union on Wednesday promised 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of financing and investments...\nLoad more\nOPINIONOriol Caudevilla40 PostsKeith Morrison134 PostsSonny Lo Shiu Hing281 PostsJosé Carlos Matias113 PostsJosé I.

Earlier, the boat’s skipper and a fisherman managed to save themselves by jumping off the boat.“The survivors are identified as Te Chia Haur, 40, and Tee Kian Muar, 33. Both were rescued by a local fishing boat that was nearby,” said Mohd Haniff in a statement today.Mohd Haniff said the two other fishermen, Te Chia Rong, 38, who is the younger brother of Chia Haur, and Chia Hock Neng, 60, were missing.He said both men were believed to be sleeping before the incident.Mohd Haniff said Johor Baru MRSC activated the SAR operation at 8pm last night where Batu Pahat MMEA immediately despatched a Kilat 47 patrol boat to the scene.“At the location, the fishing boat could not be sighted as it had already sunk.“However, the team managed to rescue the two survivors who were later brought back to the Batu Pahat MMEA jetty and placed in the care of the Sultanah Nora Ismail Hospital medical team,” he said, adding that the men were reunited with their families after getting a clean bill of health.Mohd Haniff said the operation to find the missing crew continued this morning with additional assets from the Marine Police Force (PPM) and the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN).He appealed to those with any information to contact the Batu Pahat Maritime Zone Operations Centre hotline at 07-4344020 or the MERS 999 emergency helpline.\nYou May Also Like\nRelated Articles\nMalaysia /                                                 9 h ago                      Malaysian and Russian universities form groundbreaking partnership to foster global learning, address workforce skill gaps                          Malaysia /                                                 9 h ago                      Miri landslide: Last victim found, SAR operation concludes                          Malaysia /                                                 9 h ago                      Robbed at taser-point in Johor: Elderly woman attacked outside Skudai home\nJust IN                 9 h ago Malaysian and Russian universities form groundbreaking partnership to foster global learning, address workforce skill gaps               9 h ago Miri landslide: Last victim found, SAR operation concludes               9 h ago Robbed at taser-point in Johor: Elderly woman attacked outside Skudai home\nNews\nMalaysia\nSingapore\nWorld\nMoney\nLife\nEat/Drink\nShowbiz\nOpinion\nWhat You Think\nSports\nTech/Gadgets\nAbout\nARCHIVES\nABOUT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\nADVERTISE\nDownload\nSubscribe to Newsletter\nName\nEmail\nSubscribe\n© 2024, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved.\n↑",

It was learnt that the victim, Pradip Sardar, a resident of Katamari village in Kultali, went to catch crabs and fish on Thursday night at Nayabanki with two others.  A tiger is said to have jumped at him and dragged him into the forest. Two other persons accompanying him managed to chase away the tiger and were able to retrieve the victim from the grasp of the beast. However, the fishermen testified that he was dead by the time he was recovered from the jaws of the tiger. The body of the victim was brought to his village. Police and Forest department were subsequently informed. The body was later sent for autopsy. It was learnt that Sardar’s family was dependent on him and his death has left them in shock and financial distress. Such attacks are becoming frequent as recently another fisherman was attacked in Kumirmari village’s Dakshinpara area. The fisherman was attacked while he was on his boat inside a creek looking for crabs. FollowMPost Next StoryExclusiveView AllRead MoreLatest News.View AllRead More © Copyrights 2022.

Two bodies were found close to where fishing boat L’Ecume II sank off the coast of Jersey on Thursday, States of Jersey Police said. The vessel was carrying three people, who are all believed to have died. In a statement released on Tuesday confirming the discovery, the force said: “The States of Jersey Police can confirm that two bodies have been located in the area of L’Ecume II. “The search and recovery operation is ongoing and will continue while the weather permits. “Family members continue to be supported by specially trained police family liaison officers. “A further update will follow when available.”\nHuge search and rescue operation for three people missing after boat sinks off UK coast\nA search and recovery operation to find all three bodies will continue while the weather permits, police said\n(\nImage:\nITV News)\nThe Commodore Goodwill, a freight ship owned by Condor Ferries, and an 18-metre fishing boat called the L’Ecume II trawler collided off the coast of Jersey at about 5.30am on Thursday. The fishing boat's skipper Michael Michieli and two Filipino crew members were said to be the only three onboard. An initial search and rescue mission was temporarily suspended on Thursday and resumed the following morning, but sadly by Friday afternoon the Port of Jersey confirmed it would transition into a recovery operation.\nMichael 'Mick' Michieli was on board the L’Ecume II at the time of the collision\n(\nImage:\nJersey Coastguard)\nLarry Simyunn is one of the three crew members understood to have died\n(\nImage:\nPA)\nThe sunken ship had also been located underwater, but it is 40 metres deep - meaning divers cannot access it without specialist equipment. A maritime exclusion zone has since been in place for the collision site and surrounding area. A spokesperson for the Port of Jersey said last week: \"All possible rescue activities will have been exhausted in an effort to find the three missing fishermen.  \"We are aware that this is very difficult for friends and family of the men, and we extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragic incident.\"\nThe search was launched for three after a fishing boat smashed into a ferry in the English Channel, just off Jersey\n(\nImage:\nITV News)\nA large offshore support vessel commissioned by Ports of Jersey began using an underwater robot on Sunday to conduct a detailed search of the site. Two parallel investigations into the collision are continuing and likely to take several weeks to complete, a spokesperson said on Monday. An investigation has been commissioned in accordance with Jersey’s Shipping Law 2002 by Jersey's minister for economic development, tourism, sport and culture. The Ports of Jersey said they would also call on \"external organisations, like the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch, if any extra technical expertise is required.\"\nCrew member Jervis Ramirez Baligat was on the fishing boat L'Ecume II\n(\nImage:\nPA)\nMeanwhile, a safety-focused investigation is being run by the flag state for the Commodore Goodwill (Bahamas Maritime Authority) in collaboration with Jersey as the coastal state party. An online fundraiser set up by the daughter of skipper Mr Michieli has raised more than £80,000 since the crew was reported missing. The money raised quickly surpassed the initial target of £3,000 and will go towards supporting the families of his two crew members, she said.

He was pulled under the water and the croc refused to free his bodyEmergency services freed the man's body from the crocodile's jaws (Image: ViralPress)ByKelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter15:50, 13 Sep 2024A fisherman was killed after he was stalked by a huge crocodile which snatched him from the banks of a river and pulled him underwater.  The 16ft-long crocodile grabbed 45-year-old Rusdi Tambah who was fishing along the Matamba River in Malaysia yesterday morning. The animal pulled him underwater and refused to let go of the man's body, keeping him tightly inside his closed jaws. A team of eight firefighters, along with wildlife department officers, joined the search and found the croc around 200ft from where Rusdi was attacked before the operation to retrieve his body began. The beast refused to give up Rusdi's body, so wildlife officers shot it five times, which eventually killed the animal. Sumsoa Rashid, head of the Lahad Datu Fire Department, said: \"Witnesses told us the victim was fishing on the riverbank when a crocodile attacked him. We were forced to fire five shots to paralyse the reptile. After the crocodile was confirmed dead, we evacuated the victim's body.\"\nThe crocodile was shot\n(\nImage:\nViralPress)\nThe massive reptile measured 16ft in length\n(\nImage:\nViralPress)\nThey tied its legs and body with a rope while Rusdi's body was pulled from its mouth. A rescuer draped a cloth around his body, which has been covered in bite marks from the crocodile's sharp teeth before being retrieved. The local fire department head added: \"We urge the public to be more vigilant when doing activities near the river. The Matamba River is one of the habitats of estuarine crocodiles.\" The crocodile was buried near the river with the help of residents while Rusdi was returned to his family.  Conflicts between humans and crocodiles are rare in cities in Malaysia.

Only one returned to shore. He received medical attention before he was transported to the Commonwealth Health Center where he was discharged the same day, the Department of Public Safety said.DPS said after it received a call regarding an overdue fisherman at 7:55 p.m.  Saturday, a rescue boat was launched and searched the area from Pakpak Beach to the Coral Ocean Point beach area. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter joined the search, DPS said.The search was called off at 2 a.m. and resumed the next day, Sunday, but there was still no sign of the missing fisherman.The operation continued Monday with some relatives of the missing fisherman joining the search.As 72 hours had passed since the report about an overdue fisherman, DPS called off its search efforts Tuesday afternoon.On Saturday evening, the CNMI Emergency Operation Center State Warning Point issued a public marine advisory regarding hazardous surfs of 7 to 9 feet, and rip currents that “can sweep even the best swimmer away from shore into deeper water.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nMissing Fisherman\nPakpak Beach\nBryan Manabat\nReporter\nBryan Manabat studied criminal justice at Northern Marianas College.

Thankfully, 14 others were successfully rescued.\nLeadership quoted a source to have disclosed that three bodies have been recovered so far, while ongoing efforts are being made to retrieve the remaining eight bodies.\nConfirming the incident, the chairman of Andoni local government area council, Hon. Erastus Awortu, told journalists that most of the victims of the boat mishap were from Ngo Town, Ataba, Isiama and other communities in the LGA.\nAwortu, in a statement made available to journalists in Port Harcourt, said the situation was being monitored to offer further support especially to give the survivors necessary medical attention and recover the remains of the dead from the sea.\nHe promised to do whatever it takes within his powers to reduce the burden of grief of the bereaved families and the affected communities.\nRelated Topics:Boat AccidentRivers Boat MishapRivers State\nAdvertisement\nYou may like\nPower Will Come And Go – Fubara Declares On 50th Birthday\nNSCDC Nab Eight Suspected Crude Oil Thieves In Rivers\nFull List: Lagos Generates ₦2.75 Trillion In VAT, Rivers, FCT Claim Second, Third Spots\nWike vs Fubara: PDP Insists Ewor Remains The Party’s Rivers State Executive Chairman\nPolice Arrest Two ‘Pastors’ With Fetish Items In Rivers\nPDP NWC Backs Rivers Congress Nullification, Reaffirms Fubara’s Leadership\nAbout Us\nOur Team\nAdvertise With Us\nContact us\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright © 2025 Naija News.

McKee, age 75, of Sitka, died on the Lisa Jean in onboard machinery below deck while off Kruzof Island, according to an Alaska troopers’ statement.A sportfishing charter vessel in the area had transported an uninjured crewman from the Lisa Jean, back to Sitka at the time of the initial emergency call. Troopers responded in cooperation with Sitka Fire Department, and found and recovered McKee’s body.A good Samaritan vessel on scene towed Lisa Jean to protected waters so the investigation could be completed, then towed the vessel into Sitka. The commercial accident investigation is continuing through the USCG Marine Safety Detachment.Barry McKee's family has set up a GoFundMe to help during this difficult time.[This story originally misidentified the Lisa Jean boat.

No further details were immediately available.Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other's waters.Sri Lankan fisheries ministry officials said they were planning to have fresh talks with the Indian side which they hoped would facilitate a permanent solution.The ministry secretary, Indu Ratnayake, said there are eight Indian fishing boats that are currently being held in Lanka for alleged poaching.In a similar incident in January, four Indian fishermen were killed.India had lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over the death of the four Indian fishermen in the collision between their vessel and the naval craft of the island nation, saying steps should be taken to ensure that such incidents do not recur.The bodies of the fishermen, who hailed from Tamil Nadu, were later handed over to India.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) at the time said a strong demarche was made to Sri Lanka's Acting High Commissioner in New Delhi while the Indian envoy in Colombo also lodged a protest with the country's foreign ministry.During his visit to India in February last year, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had agreed to resolve the long-festering fishermen issue with a \"humane approach\".\nShow full article\nComments\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world\nFollow us:\nSri Lanka, Indian Fishermen\nRelated News\n\"I Don't Let Cricket Dictate My Life\": Usman Khawaja After 16th Test Century In Galle\nSteve Smith Surpasses Sunil Gavaskar In Elite List, Becomes 3rd Fastest Batter To...\nSteve Smith, Usman Khawaja Slam Unbeaten Tons, Australia On Top vs Sri Lanka\nTrending News\nUS Justice Department Move Against Gautam Adani A \"Strategic Blunder\": Report\nMeet Luo Fuli, The 29-Year-Old \"AI Prodigy\" Behind DeepSeek's Meteoric Rise\nVirat Kohli Declines Team Manager's Offer, Wins Hearts For His Simplicity\n\"No Definitive Link To Foreign State\": Canada On Khalistani Terrorist's Murder\n30 Dead, 60 Injured In Maha Kumbh Stampede, Says UP Top Cop\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nQuick Links\nLatest News\nPNR Status\nEducation News\nBusiness News\nSports News\nMP Chhattisgarh News\nNDTV Profit\nMarathi News\nBudget 2025\nCanada Election\nMaha Kumbh 2025\nAdvertisement\nFollow us on\nfacebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nwhatsapp\nthreads\nsnapchat\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nEPG Services\nChannels\nDisclaimer\nFeedback\nInvestors\nRedressals\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nPartner Content\nArchives\nNDTV Group Sites\nNews\nHindi\nBusiness\nMovies\nCricket\nFood\nTech\nEducation\nHealth\nLifestyle\nMPCG\nRajasthan\nMarathi\nThis website follows the DNPA Code of Ethics\n© Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2025.

The missing fisherman has been identified as Mahesh (32). He and another fisherman, Wilson had ventured out to the sea early in the morning to anchor their boat in Vizhinjam in preparation to go fishing on Sunday. Delayed response by the Coastal Police triggered protests.The incident happened at around 8.15am when their boat capsized. Wilson was rescued by lifeguards and brought to shore safely. The search for Mahesh is still ongoing. Lifeguards and local fishermen have been involved in the search efforts, but there has been no sign of Mahesh. “The chances of rescuing Mahesh are very low. The water flow is now inward, it is possible to rescue someone only if they are on the water surface. Mahesh is healthy and experienced with the sea, but since their boat overturned off the coast, lifeguards suspect he might have hit his head on the rocks,” said Robin, a lifeguard. Residents expressed frustration over the delayed response from the coastal police and lifeguards, who reportedly arrived at the scene around 10 am, almost two hours after the boat capsized. They added that the delay reduced the chances of a successful rescue. “The delayed response from the authorities is unacceptable,” said Ajith Shankhumukham, a resident and activist. Residents are mostly of the opinion that the unscientific shoreline protection methods have destabilised the coastline, making it difficult for fishermen to predict sea conditions. Residents of Shankhumukham have long been concerned about the lack of proper anchoring facilities in their area, which forces them to travel to Vizhinjam. According to them, this adds unnecessary risks to their daily activities. “The argument that sea walls are unscientific is baseless. Sea levels are rising, and water from areas like Azhimukham, Poovar, and Poonthura ultimately flows into the sea. Without the construction of sea walls, the impact of the waves would be even stronger,” added Robin.MLA Antony Raju visited the site on Saturday morning and addressed the concerns of the locals. He said that the coast guard had responded as quickly as possible, considering the distance from Vizhinjam and promised that no further delays were caused by the coast guard’s response. The man who escaped after the boat capsized was Vincent. Mahesh’s wife Sandra Manian is a homemaker.They have two children – Liya, 7, and Rayan, 5.

The body of M Raja (a) Karavadaiyan, a resident of Arisipalayam near Govindhapadi in Kolathur in Salem district, was found floating on Palar River by the Salem district police on Friday. Salem superintendent of police R Sivakumar, however, said the cause of death could be conclusively established only after getting the postmortem report.M RajaAs villagers alleged that he was shot dead by Karnataka forest personnel, tension prevailed in border areas and Tamil Nadu and Karnataka authorities deployed additional police force to maintain law and order. Vehicular movement was also affected for some time. According to sources, a group of fishermen from Salem were fishing near the confluence of Cauvery and Palar rivers on Tuesday when Karnataka forest department personnel allegedly opened fire and killed one of them. Police sources said, “On February 14 night, Raja and four others from Salem were fishing at Palar on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. The gang is suspected to have gone for hunting in forests on the banks of the rivers when Karnataka forest department personnel allegedly opened fire on them.While everyone jumped into the river and escaped, Raja did not return home and was untraceable.” Subsequently, Raja’s relatives lodged a missing complaint at Mettur police station on Thursday. The relatives also told police that Karnataka forest personnel had shot Raja.‘Reason for death can be ascertained only after autopsy’The Mettur police registered a man-missing case and were investigating. “On Friday, police received information about Raja’s body floating on Palar near Kaveri Puram of Erode district. They sent the slightly decomposed body to Salem GH for postmortem. A case registered under Section 174 CrPC (drowning),” sources said. V Sasimohan, Erode superintendent of police, said, “As the body was decomposed, it could not be immediately ascertained whether he died of gunfire or drowning. Full details will be known only after we get the postmortem report.”Additional police forces have been deployed at Karaipatti check post on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border near Kolathur in Salem district to avoid untoward incidents. Interstate vehicular movement was stopped for a while, sources said. Salem SP R Sivakumar said, “A postmortem will be held on Saturday. At present, police are engaged in security operations at important places on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. Traffic between the two states is smooth.”“Raja has several cases pending against him. In 2018, when Raja and his friend Palani went on a similar hunt together, Palani died in firing by Karnataka forest personnel,” police said. Communist Party of India (CPI) and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) criticised Karnataka forest department for firing on Tamil Nadu fishermen.CPI state secretary R Mutharasan expressed his condolences to the victim’s family, and in his statement, called on the state government to conduct a thorough probe and provide compensation to the family. Meanwhile, PMK president Dr Anbumani Ramadoss also condemned the alleged shooting and called on the state police to register a case and arrest the accused. He also requested the state government to provide a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the victim’s family and a government job to one of his family members.Postmortem  to be carried out today CM MK Stalin condemned the Karnataka forest department for firing at the TN fisherman and announced `5 lakh solatium to his family. Erode SP V Sasimohan said the reason for Raja’s death will be known only after getting the autopsy report.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

(Image for Representation)In an unfortunate incident in the Chilmari forest of the Sundarban area in  West Bengal, a fisherman was killed by a tiger, who reportedly dragged his body. On Monday, three fishermen of Sundarbans had set out to catch crabs from Parashamani village, which comes under the Lahiripur gram panchayat.According to witnesses, while the three fishermen were catching crabs at around 10 am on Tuesday, a tiger suddenly leapt out of the bushes, jumped on the boat, and pounced on Chittaranjan Sarkar. The rest of the fishermen rushed after the big cat with sticks while shouting, but it was too late.related storiesAccording to sources, Subrata, Chittaranjan, and Subal went to catch crabs in the Chilmari canal of Jhila No. 4. At that time a tiger jumped into the boat silently without anyone noticing. Although Subrata and SUbal came out unscathed, they could not save their third colleague.Following this incident, the forest department was informed. The Sundarbans Tiger Reserve Field Director said that the fishermen fell into the creek while catching the crabs and were attacked by the tiger. Chitta Sarkar was accompanied by his friends Subal Mandal and Subrata Kayal. Sarkar, a resident of the Gosaba block, is survived by his four children and a wife.top videosView allSwipe Left For Next VideoView allSuch incidents, however, are extremely common in the Sundarban area, where residents are locked in a perpetual war of livelihood vs the dangers of the wilderness. In November 2021, 69-year-old Hazari Mondal, hailing from Chargheri in Lahiripur in the Gosaba block, had lost his life while catching crabs. According to a report in The Times of India, he had also gone fishing in the Jhila canal, just like Chittaranjan Sarkar and his companions.Read all the Latest India News heretags :SunderbanstigerFirst Published:February 02, 2022, 18:05 ISTNews india  In Bengal, Tiger Kills Fisherman, Drags His Body To Forest; Narrow Escape For 2 OthersRead MoreAdvertisement More Impact ShortsLatest newsSanya Malhotra Is Proud Of Sky Force Director Abhishek Anil Kapur: ‘You Have Come A Long Way’National School of Drama Director Says Shah Rukh Khan Is A ‘Natakwala First, Superstar Later’Skoda Kylaq Classic Bookings to Reopen on January 27, Deliveries and Test Drives to Begin SoonSharvari Seeks Blessing At The Siddhivinayak Temple With Family: ‘Just Have Faith’‘Will Take Up Matter With US…’: MEA On Khalistani Terrorist Pannun's Presence At Trump's Eventmore latest news live tvCNN News18ChannelsAdvertisementAstrology View More            January 24, 2025Choose ZodiacChoose ZodiacariestaurusgeminicancerleovirgolibrascorpioSagittariuscapricornAquariusPiscesTodayWeeklyMonthlyYearly...read moreAstrology NewsMore Astrology NewsTrending Videos View More More Trending VideosLatest Blogs Photogalleries View MoreMore PhotogalleriesAdvertisementPreviousNextTrending TopicsSaif Ali Khan8th Pay CommissionChampions TrophyDelhi ElectionsNarendra ModiDonald TrumpElon MuskArvind KejriwalSalman KhanRohit SharmaShraddha KapoorDisha PataniAnanya PandayMovie ReviewsMalaika AroraRashmika MandannaTripti DimriShah Rukh KhanWeb StoriesKriti SanonHot On SocialShehnaaz GillMouni RoyJanhvi KapoorDeepika PadukoneKareena Kapoor KhanSalman KhanVirat KohliSanya MalhotraRohit SharmaRanveer SinghNikki TamboliSonali RautAlia BhattTamannaah BhatiaSonam BajwaAmitabh BachchanNayantharaBobby DeolUrfi JavedSobhita DhulipalaPopular CategoriesLatest NewsIndiaMovies WorldPolitics ViralAutoTech VideosPhotosWeb Stories CricketExplainersShowshaOpinion LifestyleBusinessEducation-CareerSportsCity NewsElectionsLanguage SitesMarathi NewsGujarati NewsBengali NewsTamil NewsTelugu NewsMalayalam NewsPunjabi NewsUrdu NewsAssam NewsOdia NewsKannada NewsNetwork18 Group SitesTopperLearningMoneycontrolFirstpostCNBCTV18History IndiaMTV IndiaFollow Us OnNews18 App Download NowAbout UsCookie PolicyDisclaimerContact UsRSSComplaint RedressalAdvertise with UsSitemapPrivacy PolicyCNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2024 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The not knowing is just what’s really killing all of us. We just want them found,” said Jennifer Wilkinson who’s the mother of Caleb. “We have no idea. We’ve had no contact. The couple of leads we did have where they said they got visuals of them has given us hope. So we just want to keep getting leads in if anyone has laid eyes on them or seen them we want to know where as soon as possible.”Wilkinson said the families are slated to have a meeting with Coast Guard officials around noon Tuesday in Brunswick for an update on the search.Other people in the local maritime community are surprised they haven’t been found yet. “Every boat here has an EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon). Just about… if you go down it activates. Shows your location. So, I mean if they got hit by a rogue wave and they were all asleep and couldn’t find the EPIRB, the batteries were dead. That’s practical. … they were in the drink before they knew what was happening. That’s very strange,” said Michael Gill who knows members of the crew.Involved in the search are:Coast Guard Air Station ClearwaterCoast Guard Air Station Elizabeth CityCoast Guard Air Station SavannahCoast Guard Station BrunswickCoast Guard Cutter IbisGeorgia Department of Natural ResourcesSo far search crews have scanned more than 20,000 square miles from Brunswick to Charleston. Anyone with information that might help search efforts should contact Sector Charleston at 843-740-7050.The @USCG is searching for an overdue 31-foot fishing vessel, Friday, with 3 people aboard 80 miles offshore #Brunswick, Georgia.Anyone with information that may assist search efforts should call Sector #Charleston at 843-740-7050.More details here: https://t.co/G2qswnGjlq pic.twitter.com/BefJ2GpjOp— USCGSoutheast (@USCGSoutheast) October 20, 2023 Copyright 2023 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.About the AuthorScott Johnson headshotScott JohnsonScott is a multi-Emmy Award Winning Anchor and Reporter, who also hosts the “Going Ringside With The Local Station” Podcast.

The body of a missing fisherman has been found after a two-day search, but by the time the authorities tracked him down he had been partially devoured by sharks.The victim was last seen on May 10, fishing in the waters off Lubang in the Philippines, according to GMA News Online.When the authorities first saw his body, they thought it was a bird floating on the water, Lubang Mayor Mike Orayani told GMA News. It was only after they got closer that they saw it was a corpse.\nWhen rescue teams found the missing man, his body was being devoured by sharks. They initially thought the body was a large bird.\nWhen rescue teams found the missing man, his body was being devoured by sharks. They initially thought the body was a large bird.\nMAYOR MIKE Orayani\n\"[When] they reached the corpse, the head was still there, [but] there were so many tiger sharks around [and] they were eating the body,\" he said.Members of the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Philippine Coast Guard were at the scene and a maritime police officer shot one of the sharks. However, they were still only able to recover half of the victim's body and return it to his family.Tiger sharks are found throughout the world's tropical and temperate waters, with the exception of the Mediterranean sea. They thrive in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters and will eat almost anything, according to the Florida Museum's Shark File.

Of these, 27 percent have been fatal, a higher percentage than any other species.\nThe man's body was half-eaten by the time rescuers arrived, although it is unclear whether he was dead before the sharks got to him.\nThe man's body was half-eaten by the time rescuers arrived, although it is unclear whether he was dead before the sharks got to him.\nMAYOR MIKE Orayani\nIt's unclear whether the man was already dead by the time the sharks got to him. A segment of the GMA News report was shared to social media, receiving tens of thousands of views on YouTube.\"There are a lot of sharks there,\" said one user.\"His death is very painful especially because he loved life so much. Condolences to the family,\" said another.Shark attacks are extremely rare, but should you ever find yourself swimming with sharks, there are a few safety measures you can take. The Florida Museum recommends always swimming with a buddy and staying close to the shore. Avoid swimming at dawn or dusk and do not swim around schools of fish or where people are fishing.If you see a shark, maintain eye contact, move away slowly and avoid excessive splashing.Update 5/16/23, 12:11 p.m. ET: This article was updated to include an additional picture.\nRequest Reprint & Licensing\nSubmit Correction\nView Editorial & AI Guidelines\nTop stories\nWhite House Rescinds Freeze on Federal Grants and Loans After Backlash: Live Updates\nTrump Directs Guantanamo Bay to Prepare to Hold up to 30,000 Migrants\nFed Pauses Interest Rate Cuts in First Key Decision of Trump's Second Term\nRFK Jr. Says He Would Study Abortion Pill Mifepristone for 'Safety Issues' About the writer\nPandora Dewan\nFOLLOW\nPandora Dewan is a Senior Science Reporter at Newsweek based in London, UK.

They sometimes spend three-four days fishing.Ismail Ssekandi one of the missing fishermen from Lujjabwa Landing Site in Mazinga sub-county. Photos by Samuel NkubaKasozi said that fishermen tend to go beyond Ugandan waters. They can go as far as Tanzania since Mazinga is located at the border.“We realized towards the end of December that they had stayed long on water which is unusual for fishermen who do fishing activities in Kalenga,” said Kasozi.It’s alleged that the boat which was used by the duo was sighted in Tanzania waters near Ukerewe island without any fishing equipment.Wasswa, the other missing fisherman.Anthony Amanya, the marine Police commander on Lake Victoria, said they are aware of the missing fishermen from Mazinga sub-county.“Investigations have commenced to find out whether the boat which was sighted in Tanzania waters belongs to them and if they are alive or dead,” said Amanya.He added that there is a need for all security operatives including Kalangala district leaders to meet fishermen on both sides of Mazinga and Tanzania to resolve issues of robbery.Fishermen want the Fish Protection Unit officers to indulge in ensuring the security of fishermen rather than only enforcing illegal fishing operations on Lake Victoria.Over five fishermen from Tanzania and Uganda were allegedly killed while on their fishing expeditions on Lake Victoria waters. Since May 2021, there have been attacks and stealing of fishing materials from fishermen.\nRegister to begin your journey to our premium content .\nLink copied to clipboard\nClose\nLink not copied to clipboard\nClose\nAll Rights Reserved © NewVision\n2025\nPremium\nMy Subscriptions\nArchives\nE-Papers Privacy Policy Legal Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact us\n+256 (0)414 337 000\n+256 (0)312 337 000\nnews@newvision.co.ug",

He secured the man, who was unresponsive.\nThe helicopter static line hoisted both the casualty man and the Metro rescue diver to the parking area at Queens Beach where paramedics commenced CPR efforts on the man (believed to be aged in his 60's).\nAt Three Anchor Bay, after extensive CPR efforts by paramedics were exhausted, on the man rescued to Three Anchor Bay aboard the NSRI rescue craft, sadly he was declared deceased.\nAt Queens Beach, after extensive CPR efforts by paramedics were exhausted, on the man rescued to the shore by the Skymed rescue helicopter, sadly he was declared deceased.\nThe bodies of the 2 deceased men were taken into the care of Police and Government Health Forensic Pathology Services.\nIt appears that the three men, believed to be from Cape Town's Northern Suburbs, reportedly well known to the fishing, boating and maritime communities, had launched earlier at Three Anchor Bay to go fishing.\nIt appears that they may have been fishing offshore of Bantry Bay when their boat was capsized by a wave.\nNSRI commend the eyewitnesses that raised the alarm and the many public bystanders who aided the rescuers at Queens Beach and at Three Anchor Bay during this tragic, sad incident.\nEfforts to assist family members remain in progress.\nCondolences are conveyed to family and friends of the 2 deceased men.\nAn Inquest docket has been opened by Police.\nFollow Us!\nHelp us save lives on South African waters.\nDONATE NOW\nSUBSCRIBE\nNext Article\nNational Incident\nRead More\nYou may also like\nRESCUES                                                                                                                     | Published: 29 January 2025\nSailing Yachts Drift Ashore at Clifton 4th Beach\nA sailing yacht run aground at Clifton 4th Beach is recovered safely, while a second sailing yacht self recovers after drifting into shallow water at Clifton 4th Beach. ...\nREAD MORE\nRESCUE OPERATIONS                                                                                                                                                                         | Published: 28 January 2025\nOngoing search for a missing man: Scottburgh Point Main\nA search is ongoing at Scottburgh Point Main Beach, KZN South Coast, where a man is reported missing. ...\nREAD MORE\nRESCUE BASES                                                                 | Published: 23 January 2025\nNew rescue base enhances readiness for Station 35 Witbank volunteers\nIn a significant milestone for the NSRI and the community it serves, Station 35 Witbank volunteers have officially moved into their dedicated rescue base. ...\nREAD MORE\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nSubscribe today for information about NSRI rescues, news and appeals\nSubscribe\nCONNECT WITH US\nThe Charity that Saves Lives on South African Waters\nHead Office\nMon - Fri 08:00 - 16:00\n4 Longclaw Drive, Milnerton, Cape Town, 7441\nCo-ordinates: 33°51.86 S  I 18° 30.63 E\nView map\nContact Info\nTel: +27 21 434 4011\nFax: +27 21 434 1661\nE-mail: info@searescue.org.za\nPO Box 154, Green Point, 8051\nSouth Africa\nRegistration Numbers\nCo.

In this photo, a view of the Long Island Sound is pictured from Westport, Conn.\nBy Joseph Wilkinson | jwilkinson@nydailynews.com | New York Daily NewsPUBLISHED: October 24, 2023 at 1:01 PM EDTA man was found dead in Long Island Sound on Monday after a small fishing boat carrying five people sank Sunday near Westport, Conn.The body of Juan Gabriel Valle Pineda, 38, was located about three miles north of where the boat sank, the Hartford Courant reported. Members of the Bridgeport Fire Department located Pineda’s remains.Another person, who has been identified only as a resident of Suffern, N.Y., remained missing Tuesday. Three other people were rescued shortly after the boat sank on choppy waters in the sound.A passing boater noticed a man standing on a navigational buoy near Cockenoe Island, just over one mile from the coast, around 4 p.m. Sunday and alerted authorities when they reached shore.Rescuers quickly responded and saved the man on the buoy and two people in the water nearby, identified only as a man and a woman. They were taken to a local hospital for evaluation, as the water temperature in the sound was 61 degrees on Sunday.Police needed translators to communicate with the people they’d saved. They were told that two other men were on the boat and remained missing. Pineda, of Spring Valley, N.Y., was one of the two missing men.“Westport Police extend our sympathies to the family of the deceased and are hopeful of recovering the second missing person,” Westport police officer Eric Woods said Monday.Authorities suspended their search for the Suffern man around 9 p.m. Monday, but Coast Guard and local police officers were back in the area on Tuesday morning and located the sunken vessel.\nWith News Wire Services\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nMost PopularMost PopularICE launches raids in NYC as part of Trump immigration crackdownICE launches raids in NYC as part of Trump immigration crackdownSelena Gomez responds to Republican politician who said she should be deported Selena Gomez responds to Republican politician who said she should be deported SEE IT: Thieves take stolen NYC subway train for joyride, post Instagram video showing them speeding in tunnelSEE IT: Thieves take stolen NYC subway train for joyride, post Instagram video showing them speeding in tunnelTrump federal funding freeze blocked by judge amid impact on Medicaid, confusion in NYTrump federal funding freeze blocked by judge amid impact on Medicaid, confusion in NYCaroline Kennedy warns Senate against ‘predator’ cousin RFK Jr.Caroline Kennedy warns Senate against 'predator' cousin RFK Jr.Two slashed in gang brawl in Manhattan Criminal CourtTwo slashed in gang brawl in Manhattan Criminal CourtFrequent Trump antagonist Jim Acosta leaving CNN after programming shakeupFrequent Trump antagonist Jim Acosta leaving CNN after programming shakeupMan stabbed by stranger in Bronx subway stop targeted for objecting to stareMan stabbed by stranger in Bronx subway stop targeted for objecting to stareCheryl Hines roasted on social media as she supports RFK Jr. in Senate hearingCheryl Hines roasted on social media as she supports RFK Jr. in Senate hearingNoem’s empty Bronx debut: Homeland Security secretary’s NYC visit has nothing to do with public safetyNoem's empty Bronx debut: Homeland Security secretary's NYC visit has nothing to do with public safety\nTrending Nationally\nFederal judge halts Trump’s federal funding freezeTrump freezes federal aid: What it means for Social Security, Medicare, universities and moreCalifornia farms fail as land values plunge amid groundwater crisisSelena Gomez responds to Republican politician who said she should be deported Florida reading, math scores fall to lowest mark in more than 20 years on nation’s report card\nMore in National News\nNational News |\n2 women arrested in kidnapping of 14-year-long L.I. girl\nNational News |\nVogue mocks Melania Trump’s official first lady portrait\nNational News |\nMissing Chicago TV station worker Kevin Spencer found dead from apparent suicide\nNational News |\nFlorida tree-trimmer decapitated in woodchipper accident\n2023\nOctober\n24\nTribune Publishing\nChicago Tribune\nThe Morning Call\nThe Daily Press\nThe Virginian Pilot\nOrlando Sentinel\nSun-Sentinel\nHartford Courant\nStudio 1847\nCompany Info\nAbout Us\nCareers\nHelp Center\nManage Web Notifications\nPlace an ad\nMedia Kit\nPrivacy Policy\nSite Map\nSubscriber Services\nArchives\nSubscribe Now\nSubscriber Terms and Conditions\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nCalifornia Notice at Collection\nCA Notice of Financial Incentive\nDo Not Sell/Share My Personal Information\nCopyright © 2025 New York Daily News\nClose",

He was still not responding. He never complained of any sickness to the clinic or anyone. St.Gabriel Paramedics visited the scene and declared him dead,” reads the police report.\nNo foul play is suspected.\nThe next of kin have been informed.\nTunacor chief executive officer Peya Hitula also confirmed the incident.\n“Yes, there was an unfortunate event where one employee was on the vessel which had docked at Namport, as the vessel was preparing to leave the following day he was found unconscious and non-responsive. The vessel doctor onboard was alerted and they called the emergency services but he unfortunately passed away in his sleep,” said Hitula.\nJaphet is among the fishermen, who have been part of the crew of the vessel since the Fishrot scandal broke in 2019.\nAt some stage, the vessel was also impounded on orders based on Article 28 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA).\nTunacor bought the vessel in December 2020 after Prosecutor-General Martha Imalwa ordered that it must be released.\nSamuel Japhet (41)\nPrevious PostNamibia’s Largest Museum Set to Anchor in Lüderitz\nNext PostSworn in\nRelated Posts\nNedbank Namibian Newspaper Cup 2025 edition launched\ninfo_e12wt4cs2 days ago\nGoagoses calls for the inclusion of netball facilities in schools & public spaces\ninfo_e12wt4cs2 days ago\nMTC Maris Cup to go ahead despite boycotting threats\ninfo_e12wt4cs6 days ago\n© COPYRIGHT 2023 WINDHOEK OBSERVER\nLike Us\nFollow Us\nSubscribe Us\nFollow Us\nLinkedIn\nNew Video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVONWDYjioo",

The search for Morgan was suspended at 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning, officials said.An accompanying female crew member was pulled from the water and declared “unresponsive,” Chief Petty Officer William Colclough said. Officials said Sunday that she had died. The woman has not been identified.Helicopter crews and lifeboats scoured a 21-square-mile area near the location of a radio distress beacon sent out by the fishing boat. Air crews located a life raft and swaths of debris from the vessel in the area.Authorities have not yet determined what caused the fishing boat to sink.— Zane Sparling; zsparling@oregonian.com; 503-319-7083; @pdxzaneIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

A search-and-rescue operation was begun with the help of navy and maritime security boats, said Thatta Deputy Commissioner Ghazanfar Qadri.\nHe said the fishing boats were out to sea when the weather forced them to return but three boats carrying 44 crewmembers sank in high winds and rough waters.\nRescue teams were sent to bring back some of the fishermen who took shelter on small islands but two of them drowned attempting to swim to the coast, Qadri said.\nHe said the search-and-rescue operation will continue until all the missing fishermen are located.\nLocal fishing boats are typically not well equipped with modern navigation gear and safety equipment. Many fishermen ignore weather warnings and take other risks to land a good catch.\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinWhatsAppEmail\nPrevious articleTaliban, Western officials meet for talks in OsloNext articleSeven junior judges contract coronavirus in Lahore\nMonitoring Report\nRELATED ARTICLES\nNATIONAL\nRecord shows May 9 cases don’t fall under state security concerns: Justice Rizvi\nNATIONAL\nIHC returns PTI founder, wife pleas against £190m case verdict with objections\nNATIONAL\nPakistan ranked 12th global military power on GFP Index\nNATIONAL\nFIA DG, KP IG Police faced the music for ‘poor performance’\nNATIONAL\nPresident assents to PECA amend bill amid widespread outcry\nNATIONAL\nGovt proposes ‘parliamentary committee’ in response to PTI demand for JD\nMust Read\nNATIONAL\nIHC returns PTI founder, wife pleas against £190m case verdict with...\nJanuary 30, 2025\nISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) registrar’s office on Wednesday returned the petitions of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra...\nPakistan ranked 12th global military power on GFP Index\nJanuary 30, 2025\nFIA DG, KP IG Police faced the music for ‘poor performance’\nJanuary 29, 2025\nPresident assents to PECA amend bill amid widespread outcry\nJanuary 29, 2025\nContact us: [email protected]\nPrivacy policy\nCopyright © 2025.

The boat, named Al-Asad, had a crew of around 45 fishermen, out of which 31 were rescued after the incident.\nOn March 5, a search and rescue operation was commenced by PN and PMSA. Despite challenging conditions, such as dense marine traffic, choppy seas, and the passage of time, the rescue team was able to recover the bodies of 10 fishermen who had been missing.\nUpon receiving information, PMSS Rehmat was able to achieve major breakthrough in the search operation today, reports the press release of Directorate General PR of Naval Headquarters.\nThe recovered bodies were handed over to the concerned authorities. The four bodies that were recovered earlier were laid to rest today.\n“The ongoing search and rescue operation by PN and PMSA is a clear demonstration of PN’s commitment to providing assistance during any unfortunate incidents at sea”\nInitially, fellow fishermen attempted to rescue those in distress, followed by coordinated efforts from the Maritime Security Agency, Pakistan Navy, and Fishermen’s Cooperative Society. These efforts led to the successful rescue of 43 fishermen, while two remained missing, prompting continued search operations. They were fished out by another launch and dropped at jetty on Thatta coast.\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinWhatsAppEmail\nPrevious articleGwadar Port Maintenance Dredging Navigation Channel project completedNext articleFazl seeks probe into notification of ‘unknown’ woman on National Assembly reserved seat\nStaff Report\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\nComment:\nPlease enter your comment!\nName:\nPlease enter your name here\nEmail:\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nWebsite:\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nΔ\nRELATED ARTICLES\nNATIONAL\nRecord shows May 9 cases don’t fall under state security concerns: Justice Rizvi\nNATIONAL\nIHC returns PTI founder, wife pleas against £190m case verdict with objections\nNATIONAL\nPakistan ranked 12th global military power on GFP Index\nNATIONAL\nFIA DG, KP IG Police faced the music for ‘poor performance’\nNATIONAL\nPresident assents to PECA amend bill amid widespread outcry\nNATIONAL\nGovt proposes ‘parliamentary committee’ in response to PTI demand for JD\nMust Read\nNATIONAL\nIHC returns PTI founder, wife pleas against £190m case verdict with...\nJanuary 30, 2025\nISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) registrar’s office on Wednesday returned the petitions of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra...\nPakistan ranked 12th global military power on GFP Index\nJanuary 30, 2025\nFIA DG, KP IG Police faced the music for ‘poor performance’\nJanuary 29, 2025\nPresident assents to PECA amend bill amid widespread outcry\nJanuary 29, 2025\nContact us: [email protected]\nPrivacy policy\nCopyright © 2025.

A fishing boat intercepted by the fishery law enforcers in Sto. Niño, Samar in this Jan. 28, 2021 photo. On June 7, a fisherman was killed while two others were hurt when they went dynamite fishing in the seawaters of Sto. Niño, Samar. (Photo courtesy of Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources)\nTACLOBAN CITY – A fisherman was killed while two others were hurt while engaged in dynamite fishing in the seawaters of Sto. Niño, Samar on Tuesday, the Philippine National Police (PNP) has reported.Emiliano Davila, 40, was about to throw the ignited gelatin sticks when it exploded, wounding two others who were standing on the motorized boat, police said on Wednesday.Other blast victims were his cousins Rolan Davila, 28 and Jorgie Davila, 31.All victims are residents of coastal Ilijan village in Sto. Niño, Samar, some 10 kilometers away from the town center.Davila died on the spot while the two other fishermen suffered multiple injuries and were rushed to the Calbayog City District Hospital for treatment.Samar provincial fishery officer Marlon Sale admitted that dynamite fishing is rampant in the island towns of the province despite the information drive and enforcement activities of local government units.“It has been the habit of some of our fishermen in Samar to resort to blast fishing to catch more. Even those who have received livelihood assistance from the government also engaged in illegal activities,\" Sale said in a phone interview.The deep seawaters of Sto. Niño town is known for its abundant harvest of sardines and spinefoot fish.Sale said the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has already trained teams in the local government to enforce fishery laws within the municipal waters.However, sea patrol is not sustained due to limited resources and different priorities of the local government.“We are working with the local government to ensure that those caught engaged in illegal fishing will be held liable,” he added.The official warned that those caught in blast fishing are liable to immediate imprisonment under section 92 of the Fisheries Code.Once proven administratively, municipal fishermen will be fined PHP30,000 while commercial fishers are bound to pay more from PHP300,000 to PHP3 million. the prison term ranges from five to 10 years.The BFAR regional office condemned the continued use of explosives, noxious, or any poisonous substances in fishing.“It does not only damage our fishery resources, but also result in the loss of human lives. BFAR continues to remind the public, especially our fisherfolk that the illegal practice of using these substances will always bring harm to the environment and human lives,” the regional office's statement showed.

The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office helicopter participated in the operation.\n“We took a missing persons report this morning. We had Henry 1 and our boating unit searching for the missing boater,” said Sgt. Juan Valencia, spokesman for the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office.\nThe man’s identity has yet to be released pending notification of family. The Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation into the death.\nThe Coast Guard assisted the Sheriff’s Office search and in turn called on others on the water to help locate the missing crabber.\n“The local fishing community helped out with the search plan of it, passing information about last communication with (the missing captain) at 9 p.m. last night,” a Coast Guard spokesperson said. “However, they did not suspect anything wrong until the report of the adrift vessel.”\nRon Keith first learned of the situation while whale watching with his 13-year-old son, Kaden. He said he heard through radio chatter a boat was adrift near Elephant Rock with no one on board about 10 minutes before the official pan-pan, a distress alert sent by the Coast Guard.\n“We went by there and circled the boat a few times and honked the horn” before the Coast Guard arrived, Keith said. “He still had his running lights on.”\nKeith also recalled a crab trap in the water had still been hooked to the boat’s winch.\nUpon arriving in the area, Coast Guard officers found the boat’s engine still running.\n“We suspected the captain fell off the vessel at some point,” the spokesperson said.\nAircraft from the San Francisco Coast Guard station located the person in the water about 1 mile from the boat. Crew on a Coast Guard boat recovered him from the water and “discovered obvious signs of death,” according to the spokesperson.\nBodega Bay Fire Protection District paramedics pronounced the person deceased at the dock.\nMembers of the fishing community said the man was known to fish alone, despite pleas from his friends not to do so, said Dick Ogg, a well-known veteran fisherman.\n“One mistake, and you’re dead,” Ogg said, describing the man as a very close friend. “We deal with this every day. It’s just horrible.”\nLocal fishermen also said the boat was allowed to run ashore despite having people in the vicinity willing to tow it and Coast Guard personnel onshore, at one point.\nThe vessel eventually grounded on Kehoe Beach, at the Point Reyes National Seashore, a hard-to-reach spot where it’s likely to break up, littering the ocean and preventing the family of the fisherman from selling it or any of the crab on board, Ogg said.\nAn official with the Coast Guard responded that the station’s single boat crew had located the body before they were able to begin towing the vessel to safe harbor.\n“We determined that the victim was to be taken back to (emergency medical services) rather than tow the vessel,” the official said.\n“We cannot task commercial fisherman with towing. Nor were we aware of anyone on scene with the capability to tow the vessel. We did not intervene with any civilian attempts to tow the vessel.”\nBy the time the boat crew was available to return and tow the vessel, the winds had picked up, according to the official.\n\"The adrift vessel was rapidly drifting towards the shore and we were not able to bring the vessel in tow,“ the official said.\nMarco Galazzo, general manager of the Tides Wharf and Restaurant in the small community of Bodega Bay, confirmed he also heard a man had gone overboard. He shared he was shaken and was anxiously awaiting further information.\nYou can reach Staff Writer Emily Wilder at 707-521-5337 or emily.wilder@pressdemocrat.com.

(Photo by Reuters)\nOne person has reportedly been killed and three others were injured when a US Navy ship fired at an approaching fishing boat off the coast of Yemen’s southeastern province of al-Mahrah province in the northern tip of the Arabian Sea.\nYemeni media outlets, citing local sources, reported that a warship opened fire on the fishermen as they were roaming the Yemeni waters off the shores of the Hawf district in search of schools of fish to catch.\nThe sources added that three people were wounded in the attack, of whom one later succumbed to his critical injuries.\nThe development comes as foreign forces have turned most of fish markets in Mahra province into military barracks and weapons depots, adversely affecting the livelihood of fishermen there.\nBack in late July, a batch of US military forces entered Yemen’s Mahrah province, as Washington continues its aggressive attempts to establish control over oil reserves and plunder natural resources in the energy-rich region.\nTwo former German soldiers sentenced over bid to form mercenary force in Yemen\nGerman prosecutors have sentenced two former Bundeswehr soldiers to jail on charges of trying to form a mercenary force to intervene in the ongoing Yemen war.\nYemen Press Agency, citing local sources, reported that the American troops landed at al-Ghaydah Airport on July 28 onboard a flight from Riyan International Airport in Mukalla, which lies on the shores of the Arabian Sea and about 480 kilometers (300 miles) east of Aden.\nThe sources, who asked not to be named, stated that the arrival of the US forces was followed by a major disruption to internet connectivity in the Sayhut district, blaming the internet blackout on the installation of sophisticated surveillance devices by American troops.\nEarlier, a top-ranking Yemeni official said US and British military trainers had arrived at a port in Mahrah on vessels loaded with munitions as well as military and logistical equipment.\nThe provincial governor, al-Qatabi Ali Hussein al-Faraj, told Yemen’s official Saba news agency on June 26 that large arms shipments aboard military vessels disembarked at the port of Nishtun, and that British and American military trainers were stationed at al-Ghaydah International Airport.\nSenior Red Cross official says 19 Yemenis suffer from food insecurity as Saudi-led war against impoverished country continues\nAbout 19 million Yemenis are currently suffering from food insecurity, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n“The Saudi-led coalition of aggression is involved in the smuggling and trade of narcotics in the area in order to perpetuate insecurity, advance its fiendish plots, and deter the local population from confronting the invaders,” Faraj said at the time.\nThe senior Yemeni official noted that occupiers and their allied Takfiri militants were trying to plunge Mahrah province into utter chaos and confusion as locals were fiercely opposed to the presence of foreign forces.\nSaudi Arabia launched the devastating war on Yemen in March 2015 in collaboration with its Arab allies and with arms and logistics support from the US and other Western states.\nThe objective was to reinstall the Riyadh-friendly regime of Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi and crush the Ansarullah resistance movement, which has been running state affairs in the absence of a functional government in Yemen.\nWhile the Saudi-led coalition has failed to meet any of its objectives, the war has killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.\nPress TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:\nwww.presstv.ir\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nUS\nYemen\nMiddle East\nUS

Street food vendors leave their mobile kiosks empty due to bad weather conditions in Kalibo, Aklan on Wesdnesday.\nJun Aguirre / Rappler\nINFO\nThe tragedy takes place moments before the Philippine Coast Guard issued an order suspending fishing, water sports activities, and select trips to and from Aklan due to strong winds\nAKLAN, Philippines – Tragedy struck in Aklan as a young man lost his life to a lightning strike while his group ventured out to sea.\nThe incident occurred just moments before the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) issued an order on Wednesday, May 30, suspending fishing, water sports activities, and select trips to and from Aklan due to strong winds.\nThe police identified the fatality as 17-year-old Aklan John Rey Almoquera of Barangay Libertad, Nabas, Aklan.\nAlmoquera was with a group who went fishing, unaware that the PCG warned fishermen against venturing out to sea because of the risks.\nThe lightning struck Almoquera’s chest, killing him instantaneously on the waters off Nabas town.\nPolice said the other fishermen were unhurt.\nThe Office of the Civil Defense (OCD) in the Western Visayas region also issued an advisory on Wednesday morning, cautioning about heavy rain and landslides expected in Aklan and Antique.\nIn neighboring Malay, the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office initially suspended boat operations to and from Boracay on Wednesday afternoon, but later resumed them as weather conditions improved. Some areas in Malay experienced flooding due to the heavy rain.\nIn the eastern towns of Kalibo and Batan, local governments suspended work starting at 1 pm on Wednesday.\nIn nearby Antique province, numerous commuters were stranded in Lauaan after the local government blocked the passage of public vehicles to temporary access roads due to flooding on Wednesday morning.\nThe Paliwan Bridge, intended to provide a safe route for commuters, was damaged by flash floods in November.\nErrol Santillan, a former provincial board member, said the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) is currently reconstructing the bridge at a cost of nearly P285 million.\nThe reconstruction work commenced on April 5, and is expected to be completed after one year. – Rappler.com\nJun Aguirre is an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow.\nAdd a comment\nError.\nPlease abide by Rappler's commenting guidelines.\nPost Comment\nCancel\nSort by\nNewest comments\nOldest comments\nSubmit\nThere are no comments yet.

World News 2 min read Reported by: Associated Press Television News Follow:\nImage: AP/Representative | Image:\nself The U.S. Coast Guard suspended the search for a fisherman on Friday, a day the small boat he had been in was found capsized off the Massachusetts coast and the other three men who had been onboard were found unresponsive and later pronounced dead.   The Coast Guard searched nearly 1,600 square miles (4,144 square kilometers) of ocean for the boat and its four passengers, who were reported missing just before midnight Wednesday. It found the boat about 7 miles (11 kilometers) northeast of Cape Ann, Massachusetts.    On Friday, it suspended the search for the last of the missing men, Bin “Michael” Cai.  On Thursday search crews found 38-year-old Jia Fu Zheng and 43-year-old Daxiao Lin, both of Quincy, Massachusetts, and 42-year-old Jaime Liu, of Litchfield, New Hampshire. They were unresponsive when found and were pronounced dead after they were brought ashore in Gloucester, Massachusetts, officials said.    The Coast Guard did not provide an age or hometown for Cai.  The four left the harbor in Hampton, New Hampshire, on Wednesday morning intending to fish in an area called Jeffreys Ledge, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore. They were due back by sunset.    A relative of one of the men called to report them missing at about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday.  Coast Guard Lt. Brandon Newman told Seacoastonline.com that there were 2-foot (0.6-meter) waves on Wednesday. The air temperature was 42 degrees (5.6 degrees Celsius) and the water temperature was 46 degrees (7.8 degrees Celsius).    The Coast Guard searched an area based on the last known position of one of the fishermen's cellphones and their intention to fish on Jeffreys Ledge.  The Coast Guard will conduct an investigation.    Capt. Amy Florentino, the commander of Coast Guard Sector Northern New England, said the decision to end a search was a difficult one.  \"\"The water temperature in New England at this time of the year dramatically reduces the survivability rate for anyone that enters the water, and we urge all boaters to keep the air and water temperatures in mind when planning their voyages this spring,” Florentino said in a statement.

The fisherman identified as Charles Opondo drowned in the Lake on Tuesday evening during a fishing expedition. Opondo, attached to Litare Beach in Mbita Sub-County, was involved in an accident when he was in the company of his fellow fishermen. According to the Assistant Chief of Kamasengre West Sub-location Meshack Wachianga, fishermen reported to his office that Odongo was standing in the moving boat to respond to a short nature call. But he lost balance and fell into the water before his body disappeared.\n\"Fishermen have reported that Odongo stood in the boat and began peeing in the lake without informing the coxswain to slow down. He eventually fell into the lake before his body sank and disappeared,\" Wachianga said. The administrator urged fishermen to put on life jackets to prevent deaths in case of such an accident. \"Suppose he wore a life jacket, his body would have floated for some time. This would have enabled his colleagues to rescue him,\" Wachianga said. He urged fishermen to embrace communication when they are travelling in a boat. \"Fishermen should communicate to one another so that one is able to tell a coxswain to slow down or stop the boat when they are pressed in any way,\" he added.\nLitare Beach Management Unit Chairman Isaiah Pero appealed to residents and well-wishers to intervene with humanitarian aid and help them look for Odongo's body. He said they had begun looking for the body.  Stay informed.

The CGA received a notice from the Lienchiang County Government at 12:30 a.m. on Friday (March 15) and sent a ship to assist the Chinese coast guard in the search and rescue mission.A source said that a 26-year-old crew member from the Chinese fishing boat \"Minlianyu 60911\" fell overboard at noon on Thursday. Initially, the fishing vessel attempted to rescue the man, but they were unsuccessful, so they returned to China to report the incident and Chinese authorities then informed the Lienchiang County Government.The CGA dispatched two or three ships in the vicinity of the incident.

Chances of him being alive are nil at this point considering the location he disappeared at. The channel is very rough and the water current here is very strong,” Kupi said.\nHe urged fishermen and sailors in Lamu to exercise extreme caution while at sea and keep off from dangerous channels like the Manda-Bruno.\nOther renowned dangerous and killer channels in the Lamu Archipelago include Mlango wa Tanu in Mkokoni, Mlango wa Ali in Kiwayu, Mlango wa Bomani in Kiunga, the Mkanda and Shella channels and Mlango wa Kipungani.\nThey are labeled ‘killer channels’ because of their location in the deepest parts of the ocean and are also characterised by rough tides and deadly waves.\nHundreds have lost their lives in those channels.\n“The sea is normally rough in December going onto January and so it’s better for all those plying here to be very careful,”Kupi  said.\nThere have been continued calls from residents and county leaders for the establishment of a well-defined emergency rescue centre to help save lives during marine accidents.\nIn February this year, the decomposing body of lobster fisherman Mbwana Badi from Kizingitini island in Lamu East was retrieved at Kwabuka beach in Faza island after he drowned at Rasini area.\n-Edited by SKanyaraADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTLatest ArticlesKenya seeking new donors to support HIV response3h agoJOHN MUCHANGIHealthNews Brief: Ruto plannig to dismiss 15 PSs in major shuffle3h agoSTAR EDITORRealtimeRuto chairs virtual EAC Extraordinary summit4h agoAllan KisiaNewsADVERTISEMENTNewsWorldAfricaCorridors-of-powerInfographicsBig-readFact CheckerNews BriefStar-farmerTwitter SpaceRealtimeBreakfast-briefingCountiesRift-valleyNairobiNorth-easternCoastCentralNyanzaWesternEasternBusinessKenyaMarketsCommentaryHealthOpinionColumnistsLeaderStar-blogsCartoonSportsFootballAthleticsRugbyTennisGolfBoxingBasketballSiasaSasaLifestyleTechnologyEntertainmentSocietyFashionFoodTravelBooksEventsPartner SitesMpashoRadio JamboKiss 100Classic 105Privacy PolicyTerms and Conditions© The Star 2024.

(SNSM photo)\nMARIGOT--French-side sea rescue service SNSM was called out on Sunday morning, January 2, to locate and save a fisherman who had fallen overboard from his vessel some twenty nautical miles southeast of St. Barths.\nRegional Operational Centre for Surveillance and Rescue in the Antilles-Guyana CROSS-AG asked the St. Martin SNSM station to join SNSM of St. Barths which already had been in the area since 2:00am with its lifeboat SNS 269.\nThe volunteer crew members from St. Martin were alerted at 10:40am Sunday and left Marina Fort Louis 20 minutes later with the SNS 129 lifeboat, taking some three hours to get to the search area more than 45 nautical miles from Marigot. Finally arriving in the area at 2:00pm, they immediately covered the search area assigned to them by CROSS.\nThe St. Barths SNSM lifeboat spotted the fishing boat, which was in a place without VHF coverage. When his crew member fell into the water, the captain had activated his Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) at 9:08pm, which alerted the emergency services. CROSS was able to reach a relative (listed as a contact for the beacon) who confirmed that the boat was indeed at sea at the time. CROSS then launched a “mayday relay” and a cruise ship was diverted to the area.\nOn site, the fishing boat informed the cruise ship of a man overboard and the cruise ship had relayed this information to CROSS-AG. They started the search and were joined by another cruise ship and a private yacht, and then by SNS 269 from St. Barths.\nAfter searching in vain for more than two hours, SNS 269 decided to accompany the remaining fisherman, who was in a state of shock, to the port of Gustavia. They refuelled and resumed the search with SNS 129 of St. Martin and a plane from Barbados which flew over the whole area and completed three search squares, in vain. SNS 269 and SNS 129 also completed their search squares, without success, returning empty-handed.\nApparently, the two fishermen had left Gosier, Guadeloupe, 10 days ago. They were used to fishing together on their 11-metre boat for more than 10 years. The captain saw his crew member go overboard, dragged by the winch. He tried to catch him, managed to grab him by the ankle, but as the crew member weighed more than 90 kilograms, could not hold on to him to get him back on board.\nHe threw him a buoy, but his crew member could not reach it and the captain activated his distress beacon. It was pitch dark and he could not see his crew member, who was not wearing a lifejacket and was not a good swimmer. The captain was taken care of by the hospital in St. Barths as soon as he arrived.\nSadly, the missing person has still not been found.\nSNSM presents its condolences to the family and friends of this fisherman, who disappeared too soon. SNSM reminds all those who go to sea that it is of paramount importance to wear a lifejacket (ideally equipped with a light) on any kind of boat, at any time and by everyone, even more so at night and on the open water.\nA simple lifejacket can mean the difference between life and death.\nPrev\nNext\nSupplements24 January 2025Small Claim?

Canadian rescuers said they were optimistic, despite the bad weather. “The fact that we have already found three survivors in a life raft gives us that hope that others were able to either get into their survival suits, get into life rafts and get off the vessel,” Brian Owens, of Canada’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, told AFP.The centre added: “The search continues for the remaining crew and we hold out hope that we will find them. We will update as soon as more information becomes available.”It said the Villa de Pitanxo sent out a distress signal just after midnight local time on Tuesday.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the government was in constant contact with the rescue services. “We’re following the search and rescue effort for the crew of the Galician boat that sank off Newfoundland with worry and concern,” Sánchez tweeted. “All my love to their families.”Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the regional president of Galicia, also said his thoughts were with the families of the crew. “We’re following the terrible news that has reached us from Canada of the sinking of the Villa de Pitanxo, a boat from Marín,” he said, adding that the regional government was ready to do whatever it could to help.Explore more on these topicsSpainCanadaAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The police and fisheries department officials recovered the two bodies and sent it for postmortem to the government hospital.On Friday, Muniasamy and three of his brothers including Arunkumar (24) and Susaisuman (20) had ventured into the sea in their boat. After the catch, when they were set to return to the shores, heavy wind capsized the boat. All the four drowned. Fortunately, Arunkumar and Susaisuman managed to hold on to the boat and escaped, while the other two — Muniasamy and Malaiselvam — went missing.After the information reached, the officials swung into action and launched a search operation. The INS Parundu and ICG’s hovercraft too were deployed. However, as the visibility was poor, they had to suspend the operation. In the early hours of Sunday, the local fishermen spotted the two bodies near the shore.A pall of gloom descended in the hamlet as Muniasamy’s wife Sowbagya wept uncontrollably with her children by her side. The family members were also in a state of shock as they lost two of their sons. Doctors said that Arunkumar and Susaisuman, who were admitted in the hospital, were recovering.The police have registered a case. Meanwhile, fisheries department officials said that they would recommend to the government for sanctioning of relief after the family members and the fishermen associations here appealed for a compensation and also a job on compassionate grounds.

Search is on for a sixth fisherman who went missing. The merchant vessel spotted the capsized boat Bigily around 42 nautical miles northwest of Kochi and alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub Centre in Kochi. The fishermen were floating in the vicinity of the boat. The Coast Guard directed fast patrol vessel Aryaman to proceed to the area. The sea was rough, and the fishermen had been struggling for their lives at sea since June 28 when their boat capsized. The merchant vessel rescued the fishermen, and since inter-ship transfer was not possible because of the rough seas, the Coast Guard picked them up using a helicopter and brought them ashore to Kochi.

The deceased have been identified as Shanavas and Nizamudeen. Two of the missing are the sons of the owner of the boat.The boat, Safa Marwa, carried a crew of 23, all of them hailing from Varkala. Seven men were rescued by a Coastal Police vessel, while 11 others were rescued by fishing boats which were close by, according to the Anchuthengu Coastal Police unit. The accident occurred when the boat was returning to the Muthalappozhi fishing harbour, according to the police.Bad weatherInitially, confusion prevailed over the actual crew strength and the number of missing persons. Rescue operations were hampered by bad weather in the region.Strong winds and rain had turned the coastal waters rough. After an alarm was raised, the Coast Guard’s Vizhinjam unit rushed two interceptor boats and a coastal patrol vessel to the region to aid the rescue effort, but bad weather and failing light made the search difficult. Two boats of the Coastal Police and the Marine Enforcement were continuing search near the harbour mouth late into Monday night.The Coast Guard ship ICGS Samar and a helicopter from Kochi are expected to join the search on Tuesday, a defence spokesperson said.It was suspected that the missing men got entangled in the boat's fishing net which had snagged on the groyne. Late on Monday evening, a crane was brought to the site to try and drag up the net. Delay allegedMeanwhile, local fishermen blockaded the Anchuthengu police station, blaming the administration for an alleged delay in launching search and rescue.In recent years, the choppy waters off Muthalappozhi have developed into a danger zone for fishing boats. The fishing community blame the unscientific design of the groynes at the Muthalappozhi harbour mouth for the situation. The region has claimed numerous lives, setting off a clamour for urgent government action.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said rescue efforts have been intensified to trace the missing men.

They tried to help him, but couldn’t as he was snatched very quickly,” he said.\nMari said the fishermen were diving for beche de mer (sea cucumbers) between Paramana and Keapara when the incident happened.\nVillage chairman Puri Holo said soon after the attack, a few fishermen rushed back to the village to inform the locals while others continued to search for him.\nHolo said crocodile attacks in that area were not uncommon, but fishermen were sometimes careless.\n“There were two other attacks a few years ago, with victims found dead with scars on their bodies, but we were not able to capture the creatures. This is the first time we have captured a crocodile,” he said.\nHe urged fishermen not only in his village but in other parts of Central to be cautious in fishing zones.\nA local, Niuni Pat, said locals with dinghies had volunteered to resume searching for the missing man after a crocodile was killed by locals on the same day as the attack.\nThe National’s attempts to get a comment from the witnesses were unsuccessful, as they were involved in the search team.\nLatest stories\nNation\nCabinet confirms Holemba as Works and Highways secretary\nNation\nMarape highlights critical areas of US-PNG partnership during meeting with US Ambassador Yastishock\nRegion\nAirbus plane catches fire at South Korea Busan airport\nRegion\nWhite House evaluates effect of China’s AI app DeepSeek\nPrevious articleLooting suspect escapesNext articleMPs urged to follow health department’s plan\nFacebookInstagramWhatsApp\nNews\nBusiness\nSports\nOpinion\nFeatures\nWeeklies\nWeekender\nSupplement\nAbout The National\nThe National is the top-selling newspaper in Papua New Guinea.

Four days ago, four fishermen including Hamsakutty had sailed into the sea from Ponnani of Kerala’s Malappuram. In the wee hours of the next morning - half past two at dawn - the boat capsized and the fishermen went missing. Only Hamsakutty got rescued. Demanding that the search for their missing co-workers be intensified, a number of fishermen blocked the national highway in Ponnani on Sunday, sitting down on the roads amid heavy rain. The protest lasted for several minutes after which the police came to talk peace with them.Fisheries Department Deputy Director Chithra M said in a release that the search has been going on for the missing fishermen in the last three days. The search is happening under the guidance of the fisheries department and the Coast Guard. Fisheries and coastal police boats have been deployed for the search. The Kochi naval base has also helped, said the release.The four men from Ponnani had gone for fishing on October 13 in a fibre boat. By 2.30 am on October 14, the boat capsized around 10 nautical miles west of Mandalamkunnu. The same day, Hamsakutty was found by fishermen who went to the sea from Beypore in Kozhikode. They informed the fisheries control room that Hamsakutty was safe, after which he was rescued and brought to shore.By 6.30 pm on October 14, a coast guard ship was also deployed for the search. The next day, a helicopter of the coast guard also joined the search team. However, due to bad weather conditions on October 16 – when heavy rains lashed the state -- the search operation could only take place early in the morning, said the government press release. The search was resumed on the morning of October 17.Watch: Fishermen protest in PonnaniFishermen, hailed heroes after their life-risking rescue missions during the devastating floods of 2018, have set out this year too to help those stranded amid rains and floods. Seven boats of fishermen went from Kollam to Pathanamthitta on Sunday to save stranded people. FisheriesRelated StoriesNo stories found.\n© thenewsminute 2025Powered by Quintype\nThe News Minute\nwww.thenewsminute.com\nINSTALL APP",

(Photo: Skidegate Health Centre FB)\nTwo Haida Gwaii men are dead following a boating incident on April 30 when their fishing vessel did not return to the village of Skidegate.The Joint Rescue and Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) in Victoria received a request for support to search just before 7 a.m. on Sunday, after the vessel had not returned.“JRCC tasked a Hercules to search the area off the west coast of Haida Gwaii, in addition to a Cormorant to assist in the search and act as a potential recovery platform,” a media spokesperson stated in an email to Black Press Media.The Canadian Coast Guard vessels Cape Mudge and Tanu were also dispatched in effort to locate the fishing vessel and men. As well a CCG helicopter participated in the large community search that was already underway.The bodies of the missing men were found by a community vessel and then recovered by the CCG around 1 p.m.RCMP media relation officer, Cpl. Madonna Saunderson said the deaths which occurred on the west coast of Haida Gwaii have been handed over to the coroner’s office for further investigation.Skidegate Health Centre hosted an all day sacred fire on the beach to honour the men and posted on its Facebook page that offered support to the community with prayers and food offerings.“We would like to reach out and express condolences to the families and community. During these difficult times, we are at a loss for words and walk with heavy hearts,” the post stated.

The vessel was, however, towed and will be subject to inspection by the Maritime Police,” he said.\nAccording to the Navy, the fishing vessel \"Alexandre\", which ran aground near the bay of Praia Formosa, in the Azores, was towed to the port of Vila do Porto, where it will be in the custody of the Maritime Police until the arrival of forensic divers.\nThe Navy also said that the alert was received at 18:45 at the Ponta Delgada Search and Coordination Center, which has been coordinating the searches since then.\nThe alert of the disappearance of the two fishermen was given by a third crew member, who was rescued alive by the fishing vessel Santo Onofre, at around 18:00, who was later picked up by the Maritime Police for Vila do Porto, “being in good condition”.\nShare this article:\nShare\nMore in News\nAlgarve dams have water for over a year\nIn News, Portugal, Environment, Algarve\n- 29 Jan 2025, 20:02\nForeign buyers have a “crucial” role in the property market\nIn News, Portugal, Business, Property\n- 29 Jan 2025, 19:02\nCosta da Caparica metro expansion\nIn News, Lisbon\n- 29 Jan 2025, 18:02\nNext article                                Lisbon bus workers on strike\nPrevious article                                End of SEF postponed again\n← Return to previous page\nSupport The Portugal News\nWe are proud to provide our readers from around the world with independent, honest and unbiased news for free – both online and in print.\nOur dedicated team supports the local community, foreign residents and visitors of all nationalities through our newspaper, website, social media and our newsletter.\nWe appreciate that not everyone can afford to pay for our services but if you are able to, we ask you to support The Portugal News by making a contribution – no matter how small.\nSingle\nMonthly\nAnnual\n€10.00\n€20.00\n€\n€2.50 / month\n€5.00 / month\n€\n€10.00 / year\n€20.00 / year\n€\nYou can change how much you give or cancel your contributions at any time.\nContinue →\nComments\nBe the first to comment on this articleSend us your comments or opinion on this article.\nMore in News\nAlgarve dams have water for over a year\nIn News, Portugal, Environment, Algarve\n- 29 Jan 2025, 20:02\nForeign buyers have a “crucial” role in the property market\nIn News, Portugal, Business, Property\n- 29 Jan 2025, 19:02\nCosta da Caparica metro expansion\nIn News, Lisbon\n- 29 Jan 2025, 18:02\nRelated articles\nEurope's westernmost lighthouse turns 100\nIn News, Portugal, Madeira & Azores\n- 28 Jan 2025, 12:05\nMobility subsidy expanded\nIn News, Portugal, Madeira & Azores\n- 26 Jan 2025, 16:02\nPico undertakes road improvement\nIn News, Portugal, Madeira & Azores\n- 12 Jan 2025, 12:02\nPopular\nHow to benefit from free travel passes in Portugal\nIn News, Portugal\n- 25 Jan 2025, 18:02\nPetrol and diesel prices to drop\nIn News, Business, Portugal\n- 25 Jan 2025, 15:02\nWhich career is most aspirational in Portugal?\nIn News, Portugal\n- 25 Jan 2025, 20:02\nOther News Articles\nUnemployment falls to 6.4%\nIn News, Business, Portugal\n- 29 Jan 2025, 17:02\nAlgarve council invests half a million in waste disposal\nIn News, Portugal, Environment, Algarve\n- 29 Jan 2025, 16:02\nPortugal weekend weather forecast\nIn News, Portugal\n- 29 Jan 2025, 15:02\nEffort rate rises for rent – but falls for home purchases\nIn News, Portugal, Business, Property\n- 29 Jan 2025, 14:02\nPortugal breaks renewable energy record\nIn News, Portugal, Business, Environment, Sustainability\n- 29 Jan 2025, 13:02\nRains increase water levels by 5.5% in one week\nIn News, Portugal, Environment\n- 29 Jan 2025, 12:05\nView all News articles\nNext article                                Lisbon bus workers on strike\nPrevious article                                End of SEF postponed again\n← Return to previous page\nSearch for missing fishermen continues\nSend us your comments or opinion on this article.\nName *\nEmail *\nTelephone\nPlease select\nAçores\nAlgarve\nAlentejo\nBeiras\nLisbon\nMadeira\nPorto\nUK\nUSA\nOther\nLocation *\nI would like to subscribe to the newsletter\nI've read and agree to the Terms and Conditions\nSubscribe toour newsletter\nName\nEmail address\nSubscribe\nI've read and agree to the Terms and Conditions\nReaching over 400,000 people a week with news about Portugal, written in English, Dutch, German, French, Swedish, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Turkish and Chinese.\nContacts\n+351 282 341 100(Chamada para a rede fixa nacional)\ninfo@theportugalnews.com\nRua Municipio de S Domingos\nUrb.

Workers Compensation Board\nTSB deems incident as a class 5 occurrence\nBy\nGrant Funtila\n02 Jul. 2024\nShare\nOn June 19, a man was fishing lobster out of North Lake when an unexpected dropping of the hydraulic boom caused an accident that killed the man in Prince Edward Islands (P.E.I), says the Workers Compensation Board.\nWCB's occupational health and safety division is investigating the accident. The victim was reportedly assisting another worker on the boat with tangled trap lines, according to the email WCB sent to CBC News. While the victim was leaning over the boat's port side, the hydraulic boom he was working on unexpectedly descended and struck him.\nRead next: Boat safety equipment for small commercial vessels: an essential checklist\n\"The hydraulic boom involved was positioned at the stern of the boat,\" the email said. \"To prevent further incidents, the boom was taken out of service and removed until a safer work process can be implemented.\"\nThe Transportation Safety Board (TSB) deemed this incident as a Class 5 occurrence, which are not subject to full investigations followed by an investigation report. The TSB says Class 5 occurences are unlikely to reveal new safety lessons that will advance transportation safety.\nRCMP Cpl. Gavin Moore said on Wednesday that police received a report about a man injured on a fishing boat, according to a report from the Canadian Press (CP). The report mentioned the man died before the vessel made it to shore.\nMoore could not say when the vessel arrived, nor could he provide additional information about the man and how he was injured. According to the CBC report, the RCMP, the coroner's office, and the occupational health and safety division of the Workers Compensation Board are working together on the investigation, unlike the federal Transportation Safety Board.\nGovernments in Canada have spent decades pushing safety messaging and developing new regulations since commercial fishing is considered one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. However, it may take time before a significant reduction in the number of deaths and injuries is seen, according to a previous report.\nRELATED STORIES\nMan dies from injury in fishing vessel\nFishing company fined $67K for death of 3 workers\nFREE NEWSLETTER\nThe FREE Canadian Occupational Safety newsletter keeps you up to date on news and analysis about the world of occupational health and safety.\nPlease enter your email address below to subscribe.\nSIGN UP\nFetching comments...\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nLATEST NEWS\nCreation of research network a 'game-changer'\nAppeal period for Alberta machine shop lapses\nWidow of stamping dies company employee calls on workers to 'always' prioritize their safety\nCourt dismisses former supervisor's conviction appeal in worker's death\nFREE NEWSLETTER\nSubscribe to the Canadian Occupational Safety newsletter to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.\nSign up\nNewsletter\nDigital editions\nAuthors\nExternal contributors\nCopyright © 2025 KM Business Information Canada Ltd.\nAdvertise\nAbout us\nContact us\nPrivacy\nCookie Policy\nConsent Preferences\nTerms of Use\nSitemap\nRSS",

At least 12 crew have been found after they survived for days by clinging to their boat when it overturned on Saturday in waters off the remote Selayar islands in South Sulawesi province. The boat was carrying a crew of 35 but two were found dead on the islands after the incident and 21 remain missing. \"We deployed a boat from Makassar to the Selayar waters. There are 49 personnel involved,\" head of the local search and rescue agency Mexianus Bekabel said in a statement Thursday, referring to the provincial capital of South Sulawesi. Bekabel said the vessel was the biggest deployed yet, equipped with two rigid inflatable boats to aid the search effort. \"We hope with more people and equipment, we can find the victims as soon as possible,\" he said. The latest survivor was rescued by a fishing boat while he was floating alone, wearing a life jacket and waving a flag near Jinato island, part of the Selayar archipelago, on Tuesday. He was taken to the island, where villagers later notified rescuers who picked him up from the island on Wednesday. \"Praise God, he is getting better and can move his body,\" Andi Sulistilawanti, the head of Jinato villag, told AFP. Authorities received reports about the incident early Tuesday but said bad weather had hampered their efforts. The navy and rescue volunteers were helping with the search efforts. Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, mainly due to lax safety standards. In 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world's deepest lakes on Sumatra island. - AFP\nOpen Modal\n×\nFollow us on our official WhatsApp channel  for breaking news alerts and key updates!\nTags / Keywords:\nIndonesia\n,\nMissing Fisherman\n,\nSearch and Rescue\nReport a mistake\nWhat is the issue about?\nSpelling and grammatical\nerror\nFactually incorrect\nStory is irrelevant\nThis field is mandatory.\nPlease provide details of the report.\nEmail (optional)\nPlease enter valid email.\nReport issue\nReport issue\nCancel\nInvalid captcha response.

Local fishermen found the remains of Yasin Johnar, 20, at 5.20pm on Monday (Aug 21) and Mohammad Shah, 19, two minutes later. Labuan Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) director Capt Nudin Jusoh said the bodies were found some 0.5 nautical miles from Kiamsam beach. \"Local fishermen took the remains to the Fire and Rescue Department which then transported the bodies to the search and rescue base,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday (Aug 22). The victims had gone fishing in an engine-less wooden boat at 6am on Sunday (Aug 20).

He added that the victim’s 48-year-old wife lodged a report at 9.04am on Tuesday (June 4) as Samsudin failed to return home. “The wife said that the victim left their house on Monday, but he did not return home, and she could not locate him. The victim also did not bring a mobile phone with him. “The wife was only able to find her husband’s motorcycle, which is parked behind a pallet factory near Sungai Benut, and she has reason to believe that the victim may have fallen into the river,” he said here on Tuesday. Supt Mohammad Shofee added that according to the wife, her husband is a physical handicap card holder as he has a limp on the right leg. “Checks with several fishermen found that they spotted the victim along the riverbank of Sungai Benut on Monday evening,” he said, adding that the SAR was immediately called at around 11am.

The State Coordination of Civil Protection of Sonora confirmed the death that occurred on Friday, December 29.\nThe man was identified as Víctor Alejandro “N”, 22 years old, originally from the town of Moroncarit. According to the report, the altercation occurred when Víctor Alejandro was carrying out his crustacean fishing activities via diving.\nAt 1 p.m., a four-meter great white shark attacked the young man, detaching parts of his body.\n“He was an unlicensed fisherman and did not have an anti-shark repellent bracelet,” Sonora Civil Protection reported about the incident on Tojahui beach.\nLocal media indicated that the young man’s fishing companions put him on the boat after the animal attack and implemented rescue maneuvers while they took him to the dock, but they could not save his life.\nIt was reported that the young fisherman had lost one of his lower limbs due to the shark’s bite, which caused him to bleed to death.\nAgents of the Huatabampo Red Cross arrived at the El Tojahui fishing camp but could do nothing to save his life.\nExperts from the Sonora Attorney General’s Office came to take samples and begin default investigations. “Civil Protection, together with municipal authorities, has insisted on calling on fishermen to coordinate with the fishing authorities to be duly registered and have the necessary preventive measures to carry out their activities,” the agency indicated.\nTYT Newsroom\nMexicoshark attackSonora\nShare\n0\nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail\nYucatan Times\nprevious post\nPeople in Sudzal protest against a foreigner who is allegedly killing their pets\nnext post\nExplosion in an apartment in Cancún, a foreign tourist is wounded\nYou may also like\nCampeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo join forces to combat the screwworm\nJanuary 17, 2025\nPoaching of sea cucumber destroys biodiversity on the Yucatan coast\nJanuary 17, 2025\nYucatan on the path to sustainable tourism with successful collective models\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe Mexican Caribbean is interested in the Asian market\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThere is still no plan for the Xocén cenote, says the mayor of Valladolid\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe disappearance of the 24/7 Medical program affects thousands of families in eastern Yucatán\nJanuary 17, 2025\nFollow Us\nfacebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nyoutube\ntiktok\n@yucatantimes Este miércoles en la gaceta semanal del The Yucatan Times:  #TheYucatanTimes #Merida #Yucatan #Mexico🇲🇽 #ExpatsinMexico #WeeklyGazette ♬ sonido original - The Yucatan Times   Headlines\nMérida received almost 2 million visitors in 2024\nJanuary 9, 2025\nHarvey update: No definite word on Houston airports’...\nAugust 30, 2017\nBritish diplomats visit Riviera Maya to strengthen bond...\nJuly 3, 2016\nCOVID vaccine: Rich countries “clear the shelves”\nDecember 16, 2020\nMan tries to kill his neighbor with a...\nDecember 18, 2021\nCampeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo join forces to combat the screwworm\nJanuary 17, 2025\nPoaching of sea cucumber destroys biodiversity on the Yucatan coast\nJanuary 17, 2025\nYucatan on the path to sustainable tourism with successful collective models\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe Mexican Caribbean is interested in the Asian market\nJanuary 17, 2025\nCategories\nSports\nPolitics\nOpinion\nFeatured\nOSY\nUnsolved Mysteries\nFun Times\nTYToons\nSponsored Content\nWellness\nHouse of the Week\nExpat Community\nView Letters to Editor\nBusiness-new\nWildlife\nEnvironment\nPlanetYuca\nTravel\nArt and Culture\nInternational\nNational\nYucatan\nPeninsula\nNews\nEntertainment\nYucaTech\nReal Estate\nCampeche\nBeach Communities\nRiviera Maya\nQ, Roo\nHistoric Yucatan\nValladolid News\nThe Column\nCultura\nPets\nMaya Universe\nFood and Drink\nFeature\nLetters to the Editor\nColumns\nLocal News\nThis is Yucatan:\nHealth\nLifestyle\nBusiness\nCrime\nState News\nHeadlines\nMerida\nYou May Also Like\nFirst cruise ship of the month disappoints businesses in Progreso\nSeptember 7, 2024\nArtificial Intelligence says Yucatán is among the states with the best tacos!\nMarch 13, 2024\nYucatán government lifts over 236,000 people out of poverty (CONEVAL)\nAugust 11, 2023\nStudy says 60% of children in Calakmul and Hopelchén live with violence\nSeptember 4, 2023\nMovimiento Ciudadano breaks with the opposition bloc in the Senate; Morena celebrates a new ally\nDecember 7, 2023\nDead turtle graphically shows the damage sargasso does to marine species\nJuly 31, 2019\nNational\nWill Trump try to mass deport non-Mexicans across...\nJanuary 16, 2025\nClaudia Sheinbaum has not been invited to Donald...\nJanuary 15, 2025\nThe Federal government will denounce a man who...\nJanuary 15, 2025\nStudents and staff of the Technological Institute of...\nJanuary 14, 2025\nCanadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre speaks out in...\nJanuary 14, 2025\nOur Company\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consect etur adipiscing elit.

U., 40, on board; Eligio P. and Ángel E. C., who had to return to the port since last Sunday and have not yet done so.\nUnofficial sources close to the Secretary of the Navy assured that the search work has not stopped; it was indicated that the operation in which the boat “Lizandro 1” was found also included the search for the ship that remains missing, therefore, the search continues to be active to try to find the whereabouts of the seamen.\nIt should be remembered that the operation is carried out by sea and air, in a coordinated effort between the Defender-type vessel and a Persuader-type aircraft, both Navy search and rescue. The agency also indicated that it will continue the search for the fishermen to preserve their integrity and be able to bring them to land as soon as possible.\nTYT Newsroom\nCelestunMeridaMexicoYucatan\nShare\n0\nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail\nYucatan Times\nprevious post\nAMLO called our work “Slander” and our reporter a “Pawn” (ProPublica)\nnext post\nLópez Obrador rejects the accusations of drug cartel’s funding back in 2006\nYou may also like\nCampeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo join forces to combat the screwworm\nJanuary 17, 2025\nPoaching of sea cucumber destroys biodiversity on the Yucatan coast\nJanuary 17, 2025\nYucatan on the path to sustainable tourism with successful collective models\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe Mexican Caribbean is interested in the Asian market\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThere is still no plan for the Xocén cenote, says the mayor of Valladolid\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe disappearance of the 24/7 Medical program affects thousands of families in eastern Yucatán\nJanuary 17, 2025\nFollow Us\nfacebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nyoutube\ntiktok\n@yucatantimes Este miércoles en la gaceta semanal del The Yucatan Times:  #TheYucatanTimes #Merida #Yucatan #Mexico🇲🇽 #ExpatsinMexico #WeeklyGazette ♬ sonido original - The Yucatan Times   Headlines\nNew safe “Taxi Naranja” is launched in Cancun\nMarch 14, 2019\nNew musical experiences and literary activities strengthen Mérida’s...\nOctober 4, 2024\nDespegar Completes Acquisition of Best Day Travel Group\nOctober 7, 2020\nYucatecan provides technological products and services to the...\nSeptember 4, 2018\nWalmart Mexico is not allowing grocery baggers over...\nJune 20, 2021\nCampeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo join forces to combat the screwworm\nJanuary 17, 2025\nPoaching of sea cucumber destroys biodiversity on the Yucatan coast\nJanuary 17, 2025\nYucatan on the path to sustainable tourism with successful collective models\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe Mexican Caribbean is interested in the Asian market\nJanuary 17, 2025\nCategories\nSports\nPolitics\nOpinion\nFeatured\nOSY\nUnsolved Mysteries\nFun Times\nTYToons\nSponsored Content\nWellness\nHouse of the Week\nExpat Community\nView Letters to Editor\nBusiness-new\nWildlife\nEnvironment\nPlanetYuca\nTravel\nArt and Culture\nInternational\nNational\nYucatan\nPeninsula\nNews\nEntertainment\nYucaTech\nReal Estate\nCampeche\nBeach Communities\nRiviera Maya\nQ, Roo\nHistoric Yucatan\nValladolid News\nThe Column\nCultura\nPets\nMaya Universe\nFood and Drink\nFeature\nLetters to the Editor\nColumns\nLocal News\nThis is Yucatan:\nHealth\nLifestyle\nBusiness\nCrime\nState News\nHeadlines\nMerida\nYou May Also Like\nFires ravaged four restaurants in Isla Mujeres (VIDEO)\nApril 27, 2021\nCarnival Cruise Line removes all July sailings from its website\nMay 6, 2021\nLópez Obrador raises flag at half-mast in Mexico City’s zócalo for earthquake victims\nSeptember 19, 2023\nNew protests against bullfighting in Mérida\nApril 25, 2022\nYucatan’s asexual people against conversion therapies\nJuly 20, 2021\nEDITORIAL: Mexico is not a failed state or a threat, despite what Trump says\nJune 11, 2016\nNational\nWill Trump try to mass deport non-Mexicans across...\nJanuary 16, 2025\nClaudia Sheinbaum has not been invited to Donald...\nJanuary 15, 2025\nThe Federal government will denounce a man who...\nJanuary 15, 2025\nStudents and staff of the Technological Institute of...\nJanuary 14, 2025\nCanadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre speaks out in...\nJanuary 14, 2025\nOur Company\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consect etur adipiscing elit.

The avid fisherman was with several friends, possibly shark fishing, diving from a boat named the Eye of the Tiguron. As he was diving for a fish, he was bitten by a bull shark. Friends valiantly jumped in the water to save their comrade, but the wounds were too severe, and Jimenez died.\nHis grieving friends transported his body back to shore.\nAnother man was injured by a shark this year\nAn unidentified 17-year-old was around 15 miles off Majana Beach on March 25, fishing with relatives when he was bitten. Family members were able to call for emergency services who had an ambulance waiting on shore. He was taken to Ciro Redondo Hospital with a large bite extending from his forearm to his upper arm just below the shoulder. Doctors said the young man arrived in shock with massive blood loss. A local blood bank provided blood for the young man who sustained serious vascular damage to his arm and forearm.\nPhotos showed doctors performing surgery on the large wound, which they were thankfully able to repair and save the young man’s life.\nBoth locations have been marked on the 2023 Shark Attack Map.\nAnother man was died while trying to cross to the North America in 2021.\nAlexis Fernandez, 28, was nearing Mexico when his boat broke apart. Footage from the incident shows a large floating mass that appears to be the remains of a human being struck multiple times by a large shark. Witness said the shark severed the man’s legs as authorities were recovering the body from the water.\nAccording to Juventud Rebelde, there have been 39 unprovoked and 5 provoked shark attacks, of which 22 were fatal, in Cuba between 1749 and 2014.\nShare on Facebook\nShare\nShare on TwitterTweet\nShare on Pinterest\nShare\nShare on Digg\nShare\n2023 Shark Attack Bite, Bull Sharkcuba\nRelated posts\nJuly 8, 2024\nKevin McMurray\nVideo: Four Bull Shark Attacks Reported in One Day in Texas\nFour people are recovering after bull shark attacks July...\n2024 Shark Attack Bull Shark\nJune 9, 2024\nKevin McMurray\nThree Shark Attacks Reported Within Hours in Walton County, Florida\nThree women are recovering after being attacked by sharks...\n2024 Shark Attack Bull Shark\nMarch 4, 2024\nKevin McMurray\nMan Loses Leg in Bull Shark Attack\nA fisherman lost his leg in a bull shark...\n2024 Shark Attack Bull Shark\nShark Surprise\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCHA2iMEZ-E&ab_channel=TrackingSharksFollow Tracking Sharks\nJoin the Tracking Sharks teamAd\nRecent Posts\nAmerican Teen Loses leg in Belize Shark Attack\nCaught on Camera Surfer Loses Leg to Great White Shark in Australia; Several Others Recovering from Shark injuries.\nVideo: Four Bull Shark Attacks Reported in One Day in Texas\nFatal Shark Attack Reported in Oahu\nThree Shark Attacks Reported Within Hours in Walton County, Florida\nad\nCategories\n2013 Shark Attack Bite\n2014 Shark Attack Bite\n2015 Shark Attack Bite\n2016 Shark Attack Bite\n2017 Shark Attack Bite\n2018 Shark Attack Bite\n2019 Shark Attack Bite\n2020 Shark Attack Bite\n2021 Shark Attack Bite\n2022 Shark Attack Bite\n2023 Shark Attack Bite\n2024 Shark Attack\nBlacktip Shark\nBlue Shark\nBull Shark\nCull\nGreat White Shark\nHammerHead Shark\nInterviews\nKeep Fin Alive\nMako Shark\nMegamouth Shark\nNurse Shark\nOCEARCH\nPorbeagle Shark\nShark Finning\nspearfishing\nTiger Shark\nTracking\nUncategorized\nVideo\nWhale Shark\nWhitetip Shark\nWobbegong Shark\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter\n.\nTracking Sharks\nMaps and data on shark attacks and general shark news.\n©2024 Tracking Sharks\nAll rights reserved\nGo to mobile version",

Of its 27 crew members, 15 were rescued, including two who were found unconscious and later pronounced dead, while 12 others remained missing. Photo by Korea Coast Guard/EPA-EFE\nNov. 8 (UPI) -- Two people died and rescuers were searching for 12 others who went missing in the waters of the East China Sea on Friday after a fishing boat sank off South Korea's Jeju Island, authorities said.\nThe fishing vessel Geumseong, a 129-ton craft, sent out a distress call early Friday morning when it began sinking about 15 miles off the small island of Biyangdo, located just northeast of Jeju, Korean Coast Guard officials told the Yonhap News Agency.\nAdvertisement\nThey said the ship had 27 crew members aboard when it began sinking, including 16 Koreans and 11 Indonesians. Of those, 15 were rescued by a nearby vessel but two of them, identified as Koreans, were later pronounced dead after being hospitalized.\nThe 12 who remain missing include 10 Koreans and two Indonesians, officials said.\nRelated\nAt least 12 dead as boat carrying migrants capsizes in English Channel\nSuperyacht wreck: Authorities question captain amid manslaughter probe\nMedics airlift 3 after 7 injured in boat-bridge collision in Florida Keys\nCoast Guard Commissioner General Kim Jong-wook activated the agency's Central Rescue Headquarters to launch a full-scale effort to find any survivors, deploying dozens of divers who searched through waters reaching depths of nearly 300 feet.\nA spokesman for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Yonhap he has issued authorization to mobilize all available resources and personnel for the rescue mission.\nAdvertisement\nCrew members said the boat capsized after unloading its catch onto a transport vessel and lifting the net, although questions remain about why the weight of an unloaded net would cause such a large boat to capsize.\nOne possibility is that heavy floating trash may have been caught up in the net, the Hankook Ilbo daily reported.

The man was not seen again and his kayak has since been recovered.\nVernon Search and Rescue responded and conducted an initial search for the man who was not found.\nA short time later, around 11:15 p.m., RCMP received a report that one person was missing after a commercial fishing vessel had capsized on Okanagan Lake near Ellison Provincial Park.\nThe boat was engaged in fishing activities and towing a smaller vessel when it encountered high waves and strong winds brought on by an overnight storm, causing the vessel to overturn. The man operating the vessel did not surface. An initial search of the area was conducted by search crews as well as an RCMP police boat, unfortunately the man was not located.\n“Concurrent searches have been organized and are underway on both Kalamalka Lake and Okanagan Lake, utilizing both Vernon Search and Rescue and RCMP resources,” said Const. Chris Terleski, media relations officer for the Vernon North Okanagan RCMP. “These are both terribly unfortunate events and our thoughts are with the families during this difficult time as we continue our search for their loved ones.”\nTerleski said RCMP resources, including the RCMP’s Underwater Recovery Team, are involved in the search Wednesday.\nWorksafe BC and the RCMP’s investigation team are working together to determine the best way to safely recover the boat from Okanagan Lake, while ensuring its removal does not compromise the investigation.\n“The situation has presented some challenges that have impacted the recovery effort and are currently being worked through,” Terleski said.\nREAD MORE: Bonfire fuels $1,150 fine for Vernon man\nREAD MORE: Nearly $40K raised for Kamloops man injured trying to save stepdaughter near Revelstoke\n@VernonNewsnewsroom@vernonmorningstar.comLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\nand subscribe to our daily newsletter.\nA police boat was parked at the dock at Hurlburt Park Wednesday, July 26, 2023.

Ross Ballantine, 39, Carl McGrath, 34, and Alan Minard, 20, disappeared off the Conwy coast on January 27 and no trace of them has been seen since. The men were onboard the Nicola Faith, a 10-metre-long boat that failed to return to port in Conwy.  Despite a major sea search involving the RNLI, no trace of the boat or the men was found and the search was called off on January 29. But North Wales Police today confirmed it had informed and was supporting the families of the three fishermen after the discovery of three bodies off the coast of the Wirral and Blackpool.\nCarl McGrath was one of the three men on board the vessel\n(Image: GoFundMe)\nRoss Ballantine has been pictured on a fundraising page for the search\n(Image: GoFundMe)\nIn a statement, the force said: \"We have been in contact with colleagues from both Merseyside and Lancashire Police, and we await the outcome of the Home Office postmortem examinations. \"The families of the missing crew members from the vessel ‘Nicola Faith’ have been kept informed, and continue to be supported by specialist officers. We would request that they are given the necessary privacy at this difficult time.\"\nAlan Minard was also on board\n(Image: GoFundMe)\nAfter the search was called off in January, the families fundraised to fund a private effort to locate them, which was due to begin today. Earlier this month, a life raft from the missing fishing boat was found off the coast of Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland.  Last month, Carl McGrath's mum, Julie McGrath, spoke about her heartbreak with her son missing.\nSubscribe to the WalesOnline newsletter today\nYou can now get all of the need-to-know news sent straight to your inbox by signing up for our free WalesOnline newsletter.

To then hear about Carl, the pain is unbearable, I can't believe this is happening, why me? Why my boys? \"Losing Anthony made me more over protective of my other two children because I was so scared of losing them. Life went on for everyone else but me after that moment, and I really struggled to deal with it. \"Me and Carl had our ups and downs over the years and for a while, we didn't speak until he had a serious motorbike accident and broke his back. I thought I was going to lose him then, he ended up on life-support, it was horrible. But he got out of hospital and back on his feet and that brought us back together again. \"I think, because I've smothered him, it's caused us to fall out again and the last thing I told him was: 'I love you, you can't take that away from me, but if you need me I'm here.'\"\nRead More\nRelated Articles\nMembers of 'armed and deadly gang' convicted of killing Harry Baker\nRead More\nRelated Articles\nCoronavirus infection rates, cases, and deaths for all parts of Wales on Monday, March 15\nStory SavedYou can find this story in  My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow Wales OnlineFacebookX (Twitter)CommentMore OnNorth WalesConwyIYA Alert County\nNewsallMost ReadMost RecentSouth Wales PoliceSchool closed after sudden death of 13-year-old boy South Wales Police said they are investigating after the sudden death of a 13 year-old boy in Neath Port TalbotHospital worker accused of planning to kidnap, rape, and murder childCourtsUniversity Hospital of Wales theatre assistant Tracy Turner has been charged with conspiring to kidnap, rape, and murder a childBoy, 11, raped younger boy twice in wooded area leaving victim 'past tears, he was gone'CourtsDaniel Hancox, now 26, manipulated his young victim and forcibly performed sexual acts upon him which had 'devastating consequences for his emotional wellbeing'Lloyds Bank closures -

It provides a nationwide maritime emergency organisation as well as a variety of services to shipping and other government agencies.\nThe purpose of the Irish Coast Guard is to promote safety and security standards, and by doing so, prevent as far as possible, the loss of life at sea, and on inland waters, mountains and caves, and to provide effective emergency response services and to safeguard the quality of the marine environment.\nThe Irish Coast Guard has responsibility for Ireland's system of marine communications, surveillance and emergency management in Ireland's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and certain inland waterways.\nIt is responsible for the response to, and co-ordination of, maritime accidents which require search and rescue and counter-pollution and ship casualty operations. It also has responsibility for vessel traffic monitoring.\nOperations in respect of maritime security, illegal drug trafficking, illegal migration and fisheries enforcement are co-ordinated by other bodies within the Irish Government.\nOn average, each year, the Irish Coast Guard is expected to:\nhandle 3,000 marine emergencies\nassist 4,500 people and save about 200 lives\ntask Coast Guard helicopters on missions\nThe Coast Guard has been around in some form in Ireland since 1908.\nCoast Guard helicopters\nThe Irish Coast Guard has contracted five medium-lift Sikorsky Search and Rescue helicopters deployed at bases in Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo.\nThe helicopters are designated wheels up from initial notification in 15 minutes during daylight hours and 45 minutes at night. One aircraft is fitted and its crew trained for under slung cargo operations up to 3000kgs and is available on short notice based at Waterford.\nThese aircraft respond to emergencies at sea, inland waterways, offshore islands and mountains of Ireland (32 counties).\nThey can also be used for assistance in flooding, major inland emergencies, intra-hospital transfers, pollution, and aerial surveillance during daylight hours, lifting and passenger operations and other operations as authorised by the Coast Guard within appropriate regulations.\nIrish Coastguard FAQs\nWhat is The Irish Coast Guard?\nThe Irish Coast Guard provides nationwide maritime emergency response, while also promoting safety and security standards. It aims to prevent the loss of life at sea, on inland waters, on mountains and in caves; and to safeguard the quality of the marine environment.\nWhat is its main role of the Irish Coast Guard?\nThe main role of the Irish Coast Guard is to rescue people from danger at sea or on land, to organise immediate medical transport and to assist boats and ships within the country's jurisdiction. It has three marine rescue centres in Dublin, Malin Head, Co Donegal, and Valentia Island, Co Kerry. The Dublin National Maritime Operations centre provides marine search and rescue responses and coordinates the response to marine casualty incidents with the Irish exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nIs the Irish Coast Guard service 24/7?\nYes, effectively, it is the fourth \"blue light\" service. The Marine Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) Valentia is the contact point for the coastal area between Ballycotton, Co Cork and Clifden, Co Galway. At the same time, the MRSC Malin Head covers the area between Clifden and Lough Foyle. Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) Dublin covers Carlingford Lough, Co Louth to Ballycotton, Co Cork. Each MRCC/MRSC also broadcasts maritime safety information on VHF and MF radio, including navigational and gale warnings, shipping forecasts, local inshore forecasts, strong wind warnings and small craft warnings.\nHow many emergencies does the Irish Coast respond to each year?\nThe Irish Coast Guard handles about 3,000 marine emergencies annually, and assists 4,500 people - saving an estimated 200 lives, according to the Department of Transport. In 2016, Irish Coast Guard helicopters completed 1,000 missions in a single year for the first time.\nDoes it also handle medical emergencies?\nYes, Irish Coast Guard helicopters evacuate medical patients from offshore islands to hospital on average about 100 times a year. In September 2017, the Department of Health announced that search and rescue pilots who work 24-hour duties would not be expected to perform any inter-hospital patient transfers. The Air Corps flies the Emergency Aeromedical Service, established in 2012 and using an AW139 twin-engine helicopter. Known by its call sign \"Air Corps 112\", it airlifted its 3,000th patient in autumn 2020.\nIs the Irish Coast Guard an all-island body?\nThe Irish Coast Guard works closely with the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which is responsible for the Northern Irish coast.\nHow much does the Irish Coast Guard cost?\nThe Irish Coast Guard is a State-funded service, with both paid management personnel and volunteers, and is under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. It is allocated approximately 74 million euro annually in funding, some 85 per cent of which pays for a helicopter contract that costs 60 million euro annually. The overall funding figure is \"variable\", an Oireachtas committee was told in 2019. Other significant expenditure items include volunteer training exercises, equipment, maintenance, renewal, and information technology.\nWhat resources does the Irish Coast Guard have?\nThe Irish Coast Guard has four search and rescue helicopter bases at Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo, run on a contract worth 50 million euro annually with an additional 10 million euro in costs by CHC Ireland. It provides five medium-lift Sikorsky S-92 helicopters and trained crew. The 44 Irish Coast Guard coastal units with 1,000 volunteers are classed as onshore search units, with 23 of the 44 units having rigid inflatable boats (RIBs) and 17 units having cliff rescue capability. The Irish Coast Guard has 60 buildings in total around the coast, and units have search vehicles fitted with blue lights, all-terrain vehicles or quads, first aid equipment, generators and area lighting, search equipment, marine radios, pyrotechnics and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and Community Rescue Boats Ireland also provide lifeboats and crews to assist in search and rescue. The Irish Coast Guard works closely with the Garda Siochána, National Ambulance Service, Naval Service and Air Corps, Civil Defence, while fishing vessels, ships and other craft at sea offer assistance in search operations.\nHow quickly can Irish Coast Guard assets respond?\nThe helicopters are designated as airborne from initial notification in 15 minutes during daylight hours, and 45 minutes at night. The aircraft respond to emergencies at sea, on inland waterways, offshore islands and mountains and cover the 32 counties. They can also assist in flooding, major inland emergencies, intra-hospital transfers, pollution, and can transport offshore firefighters and ambulance teams. The Irish Coast Guard volunteers units are expected to achieve a 90 per cent response time of departing from the station house in ten minutes from notification during daylight and 20 minutes at night. They are also expected to achieve a 90 per cent response time to the scene of the incident in less than 60 minutes from notification by day and 75 minutes at night, subject to geographical limitations.\nHow are Irish Coast Guard units managed?\nUnits are managed by an officer-in-charge (three stripes on the uniform) and a deputy officer in charge (two stripes). Each team is trained in search skills, first aid, setting up helicopter landing sites and a range of maritime skills, while certain units are also trained in cliff rescue.\nAre Irish Coast Guard volunteers paid?\nVolunteers receive an allowance for time spent on exercises and call-outs. What is the difference between the Irish Coast Guard and the RNLI? The RNLI is a registered charity which has been saving lives at sea since 1824, and runs a 24/7 volunteer lifeboat service around the British and Irish coasts. It is a declared asset of the British Maritime and Coast Guard Agency and the Irish Coast Guard. Community Rescue Boats Ireland is a community rescue network of volunteers under the auspices of Water Safety Ireland.\nDoes the Irish Coast Guard charge for rescue?\nNo, it does not charge for rescue and nor do the RNLI or Community Rescue Boats Ireland.\nWhat communications systems do the Irish Coast Guard use?\nThe marine rescue centres maintain 19 VHF voice and DSC radio sites around the Irish coastline and a digital paging system. There are two VHF repeater test sites, four MF radio sites and two NAVTEX transmitter sites. Does Ireland have a national search and rescue plan? The first national search and rescue plan was published in July, 2019. It establishes the national framework for the overall development, deployment and improvement of search and rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue Region and to meet domestic and international commitments. The purpose of the national search and rescue plan is to promote a planned and nationally coordinated search and rescue response to persons in distress at sea, in the air or on land.\nIs the Irish Coast Guard responsible for pollution response?\nYes, the Irish Coast Guard is responsible for responding to spills of oil and other hazardous substances with the Irish pollution responsibility zone, along with providing an effective response to marine casualties and monitoring or intervening in marine salvage operations. It provides and maintains a 24-hour marine pollution notification at the three marine rescue centres. It coordinates exercises and tests of national and local pollution response plans.\nWhat is the Irish Coast Guard's safety record?\nThe first Irish Coast Guard volunteer to die on duty was Caitriona Lucas, a highly trained member of the Doolin Coast Guard unit, while assisting in a search for a missing man by the Kilkee unit in September 2016. Six months later, four Irish Coast Guard helicopter crew – Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciarán Smith -died when their Sikorsky S-92 struck Blackrock island off the Mayo coast on March 14, 2017. The Dublin-based Rescue 116 crew were providing \"top cover\" or communications for a medical emergency off the west coast and had been approaching Blacksod to refuel. Up until the five fatalities, the Irish Coast Guard recorded that more than a million \"man hours\" had been spent on more than 30,000 rescue missions since 1991.\nWhat was the Government response to the Coast Guard fatalities?\nSeveral investigations were initiated into each incident. The Marine Casualty Investigation Board was critical of the Irish Coast Guard in its final report into the death of Caitriona Lucas, while a separate Health and Safety Authority investigation has been completed, but not published. The Air Accident Investigation Unit final report into the Rescue 116 helicopter crash has not yet been published.\nWhen was The Irish Coast Guard formed?\nThe Irish Coast Guard in its present form dates back to 1991, when the Irish Marine Emergency Service was formed after a campaign initiated by Dr Joan McGinley to improve air/sea rescue services on the west Irish coast. Before Irish independence, the British Admiralty was responsible for a Coast Guard (formerly the Water Guard or Preventative Boat Service) dating back to 1809. The West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee was initiated with a public meeting in Killybegs, Co Donegal, in 1988 and the group was so effective that a Government report was commissioned, which recommended setting up a new division of the Department of the Marine to run the Marine Rescue Co-Ordination Centre (MRCC), then based at Shannon, along with the existing coast radio service, and coast and cliff rescue. A medium-range helicopter base was established at Shannon within two years. Initially, the base was served by the Air Corps.\nWho was The Irish Coast Guard's first director?\nThe first director of what was then IMES was Capt Liam Kirwan, who had spent 20 years at sea and latterly worked with the Marine Survey Office. Capt Kirwan transformed a poorly funded voluntary coast and cliff rescue service into a trained network of cliff and sea rescue units – largely voluntary, but with paid management. The MRCC was relocated from Shannon to an IMES headquarters at the then Department of the Marine (now Department of Transport) in Leeson Lane, Dublin. The coast radio stations at Valentia, Co Kerry, and Malin Head, Co Donegal, became marine rescue-sub-centres.\nWho is The Irish Coast Guard's current director?\nThe current director is Chris Reynolds, who has been in place since August 2007 and was formerly with the Naval Service. He has been seconded to the head of mission with the EUCAP Somalia - which has a mandate to enhance Somalia's maritime civilian law enforcement capacity – since January 2019.\nWhere are Coast Guard Units located in Ireland?\nAchill, Co.

(social media photo) FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppReddItEmailPrint\nBy Makeida Antonio[email protected]A close-knit community was plunged into mourning following the devasting news of a drowning yesterday.According to Police Spokesperson Inspector Frankie Thomas, a multi-pronged search effort by the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda, the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force (ABDF) Coast Guard and the Antigua and Barbuda Search and Rescue was launched to locate a fisherman who reportedly fell in the waters near Shirley Heights while fishing.Police received the report of the incident around 7:00 am.Tragically, the man identified as 51-year-old Courtney Charles, was found dead a couple of hours later by the ABDF Coast Guard, approximately 9:30 am.Thomas said that further investigations are ongoing.Meanwhile, an outpouring of fond memories and sorrow filled the timelines of many social media users in the wake of losing Charles, also known as ‘Zyie’, a beloved member of Liberta village.A woman who claimed to be Charles’ sister, recounted his recent 51st birthday celebration and shared her hope for the family to come to terms with the tragic event and live on with his memory in their hearts.“I lost one of my brothers today, Courtney Winston Charles better known as Zyie.  He just celebrated his 51st Birthday on the 6th June 2022, along with his son, my nephew Keyon Charles. God said…find comfort in his words, and today, Lord, grant us as a family the courage to accept what has happened and be comforted in the memories and fond moments we’ve shared.”Charles’ son, Keyon Charles, also shared a message on his social media page on the passing of his father. “Yeah Papa. You left me heart a hurt ya now. I’ll try to hold the faith and carry on. IMMA MISS YOU PAPA.”Member of Parliament for St. Paul, E.P. Chet Greene, sent his condolences to Charles’ family members.“I extend my condolences to Yvonne, Namba, Valerie, St. Elma and the rest of the family and friends on the tragic and untimely passing of Zyie earlier this morning.”Other social media contributors referred to Charles as their friend and a “sweet soul,” and they expressed shock at his passing, right after celebrating his birthday.One friend told of the last time that they spoke to each other.“Me can’t believe this; just the other day you pass and say, ‘Love-sponge, me long for see you’ and we making jokes. Never think that would be the last ‘Love-sponge’ I would hear.”\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppReddItEmailPrint\nPrevious article‘We are monitoring this disease closely’, says Tourism MinisterNext articleAstaphan: JCPC decision paves way for Barbuda land ownership Michael\nRELATED ARTICLES\nFamilies of four unclaimed bodies urged to make burial arrangements within...\njennelsa.johnson -  30 January 2025\nCUB continues to support MoE’s Inter-Secondary School Debate Series and Impromptu...\njennelsa.johnson -  30 January 2025\nPassport fraud case committed to the High Court again\njennelsa.johnson -  30 January 2025\nNO COMMENTS\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nPlease enter an answer in digits:five × 1 =\nABOUT USFOLLOW US\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYoutube\n© Newsco Ltd. 2022",

However, the swimmer was unable to access the cabin without breaching equipment, the sheriff’s office said.\nThe Henry-1 crew then retrieved a paramedic from the Marin County Fire Department and was tasked with a 100-foot-long line rescue (video attached). According to the sheriff’s office, the boat “was resting on rocks and being battered by the incoming waves, causing it to list to the side.”\nBoth a tactical flight officer and the paramedic were inserted into the boat with breaching tools. Once the crew gained access, they determined the person inside the boat to be deceased.\nThe body was turned over to the Marin County Coroner’s Office, which will be investigating the death. The subject’s identity is being withheld pending the notification of their next of kin.\n“We would like to send our condolences to the subject’s family during this difficult time,” the sheriff’s office said.\nAccording to the Office of Spill Prevention and Response, the fishing boat’s diesel capacity was reported at about 400 gallons. It is unknown at this time if any product has been leaked.\nOSPR is coordinating with the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Southwest, NOAA’s Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries, National Park Service, and the Marin County Government to assess the vessel’s status and potential pollution onboard.\nThere have been no observed impacts to wildlife at this time, OSPR said. The investigation is ongoing into the cause of the crash.\nStay tuned to KRON4 for more updates.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

They did not have any ice and salt for the fish, so the smell of the rotten fish was too strong. The three fishermen died from suffocation due to a shortage of oxygen and an inadequate fan cooling system”, an expert from Myeik Township said.\nThe three fishermen are Maung San Hla (Ngepyatchay), Nyi Nyi, and Kyaw Win Maung from Laynyin Taung village in Mrauk-U Township, Rakhine State. They were cremated at the WatlanNote Monastery in Pattani on 3 and 4 April.\nThe fishermen’s families have been told that they are entitled to 1,080,000 baht compensation for each death from the Thai Social Security Department.\nTo receive the compensation the families will have to contact the Migrant Workers Rights Network and ask them to help, according to the source.\nTags\nMyanmar fishermenMigrant Workers Rights NetworkMyanmar migrant workers in Thailand\nMizzima - Myanmar News - English Edition\nNEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTION\n*\nAbout\nAbout UsMission StatementCode of EthicsContact UsAdvertise with us\nContact\nwww.mizzima.com\nwww.mizzimaburmese.com\nwww.mizzimaweekly.com\n[email protected]\n[email protected]\n+95 1 295398\n+95 9421010111\nclose",

His colleagues said they were chatting with him in the evening and that they were with him inside the ship but they couldn’t find him when they woke up around 1 am. They said they searched everywhere on the ship but they couldn’t find him.On December 9th, Abayitey’s body was discovered washed ashore near Tema. While the head was missing, Dorpumor identified the remains as his brother.“Last Saturday, we went to the seashore in the evening and found him dead. We were able to identify the body and so the police from Tema came for the body and so the body is now with the police. His head was not there when we found him but since he is our brother, we knew he was the one.”The brother appealed to the Ghana Police Service to thoroughly investigate the death to unravel the truth. Also, he called on lawyers to come on board to represent the family and get justice.“When the thing happened, they arrested some of the workers but they have been released and gone back to the sea and so as a family, we need lawyers to come in to help because it is a serious thing for us because we all know how to swim because we are from a coastal area and so his death is very serious to us.”—citinewsroom\nFollow our WhatsApp channel for meaningful stories picked for your day.\nComments\nHouse for sale at Kumasi\n5 bedrooms House for sale at Kumasi (Atwima Boko)\nAdvertise here\nTop Stories\n3 hours ago\n‘I’ll serve Ghana’ – Prof. Gyampo assures after appointment to Ghana Shippers Au...\n3 hours ago\nEnding galamsey requires deeper collaboration among ministries — Murtala\n3 hours ago\nMinistry of Environment should take lead in galamsey fight, not Lands Ministry —...\n3 hours ago\nCooperate with us to expedite action on upheld 2024 WASSCE results — WAEC to par...\n4 hours ago\n‘I’ll serve Ghana, remain true to myself’ — Prof. Gyampo on GSA CEO appointment\n4 hours ago\nThere’s no neutrality in helping to right the wrongs of the nation — Prof. Gyamp...\n4 hours ago\nSomeone may have used inflated free SHS beneficiary numbers for other purposes —...\n4 hours ago\nBan on plastic bags: We must look at the alternative before thinking about an ou...\n4 hours ago\nEnvironmental Protection Agency transitions to Authority\n4 hours ago\nEngage investors who will create real impact jobs, not gov’t propaganda jobs lik...\nJust in....\nVetting: 'I’ll reintroduce anti-LGBTQ bill; Ghanaian values ...\nWAANSA Ghana salutes Alhaji Muntaka new Interior Minister\nHow does asking Ministerial nominee to sing Methodist hymn s...\nGhana Navy gets advanced maritime simulation centre\nMORE\nShould the Free SHS policy be reviewed?\nLet us know you're human\nSelect your choice and vote\nYes\nNo\nNot interested\nVote\nStarted: 10-01-2025 |  Ends: 31-03-2025\nNews\nNews\nEducation\nCrime/Punishment\nSocial Affairs\nPress Releases\nRegional News\nHealth News\nSports\nSports\nFootball News\nLeague News\nBoxing News\nLeague Table\nLeague Results\nCup Of Nations\nAfrica\nAfrica\nNigeria\nEgypt\nLibya\nCongo\nKenya\nIvory Coast\nSouth Africa\nOpinions\nOpinions\nFeatured Articles\nOpinions\nEditorial\nCritics\nCommentaries\nHave Your Say\nPolls & Surveys\nBusiness\nBusiness News\nBusiness & Finance\nCommodity News\nEconomy & Investments\nOil and Gas\nReal Estate\nBusiness Directory\nBusiness Articles\nEntertainment\nShowbiz\nLatest Movies\nVideo News\nVideo Clips\nHome\nGhana\nAbout us\nContact us\nThe Team\nAdvertising\nSitemap\nPartners\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nChange Ad Consent\nMastodon\nAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners.\n© 2025 ModernGhana",

We call upon UWA to swiftly intervene,” he said.\nRelated\nIslanders accuse govt of neglect as hippos kill 57 in 2 years\nNational\nJul 20, 2022\nUWA spokesperson, Mr Bashir Hangi said the affected residents have not officially alerted them.He advised them to be vigilant as they prepare to send their Problem Animal Capture team to the area.\"I am getting that information for the first time but if it's true, let them be vigilant as we prepare to send our technical team to capture the animals,” he said.\nAccording to him, residents who stay near the lake shoresshould avoid using the affected areas as gardens because hippos tend to get closer to the shores to nurse their newborns.“I advise those residents to stay away from the 100-metre reserves from the lake shores. With this, the hippos will be controlled from attacking their homesteads and destroying crops,” he said.\nConservationists say hippos are Africa’s most dangerous large game animals, and they kill more people every year than other predators like crocodiles and lions.For several years, stray hippos have attacked communities along the lake shores.\nIn August 2018, seven people were killed by hippos in their gardens on Bussi Island, Wakiso District.In September, the same year, hippos killed one person in Bussi and in the same month, two fishermen drowned in the water after their boat was crashed by the hippos .\nRegister to continue reading this premium article\nYes, please!\nYou already have an account?\nLog in\nRegister to begin your journey to our premium content\nSubscribe for full access to premium content\nSubscribe\nYou already have an account?\nLog in\nMonitor.

He tried to shoot in the air but the bullet hit Wanya on the head, killing him,” Col Akiiki explained.\nHowever, FPU spokesperson Lt Rauben Ndifula said the soldier was still under custody alongside 12 other suspects detained by police as investigations continue.\nUganda created the FPU as a UPDF outfit in 2017 in efforts to boost the economic viability of the fisheries sector, following rampant reports of illegal fishing practices.\nHowever, the unit's operations have been marred by extortion allegations and deadly operation with Dokolo South lawmaker Felix Okot Ogong recently telling President Museveni that FPU is illegally minting cash from vulnerable communities.\nIn response Museveni said: \"We have allowed the lakes to be invaded by even foreigners. People who come and eat the young fish. That's how the army came in.\"\nBut the Ugandan leader promised to meet elders in the fishing communities to find solutions before sending soldiers away from fishing communities.\n\"In the month of May or June I want you people who are near the lakes to guide me to get the elders of these areas.

After “many attempts,” his death was declared on the spot by an INEM doctor.\nThe Public Prosecutor’s Office was notified and the body was transported to Portimão’s legal medicine office by Vila do Bispo firefighters.\nMaritime police’s psychology office is providing support to the family members of the victim, while the sunken boat remains in the sea. The owner has already been notified to create a plan to remove the boat from the sea.\nBy Michael Bruxo\n[email protected]\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nPinterest\nLinkedin\nMichael Bruxo\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\nFLOW, a thought-provoking exhibition in Algarve\nAlagoas Brancas hosts special event on World Wetlands Day\nAlgarve dams at 49% capacity – water supply secured for more than one year!\nRainwater harvesting introduced at Faro schools\nAlgarve football round-up: Setbacks\nIllegal constructions surge in Loulé\nLatest News\nReality behind bold dream of opening “unique” bar in Portugal\n30th January 2025\nSilves sets record straight about Portugal’s new land law\n30th January 2025\nFLOW, a thought-provoking exhibition in Algarve\n30th January 2025\nGovernment wants preservation plan for Portugal’s wolves that works\n30th January 2025\nFarewell Burns Supper in Silves?\n30th January 2025\nFormer hospital administrators accused of money laundering\n30th January 2025\nLiving in the Algarve Free Seminar Events\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2cB8CGTsCsAre you considering moving to Portugal/Algarve?

U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Second Class John Highwater told KUCB an ammonia leak likely killed Kumah.“One of their crew members was found unresponsive in one of their engineering spaces,” Highwater said. “They believe there was an ammonia leak somewhere in the vessel that caused the person to fall unconscious.”A satellite call was placed from the vessel to the U.S. Coast Guard at around 4 a.m. on 18 August, and the vessel was told to return to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, as it would have taken longer to send a Coast Guard crew to the Northern Eagle. The vessel arrived in port at 5 a.m. on 19 August, but Kumah had died en route to Dutch Harbor, according to Unalaska Fire Chief Ben Knowles.“The fire department, along with NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment, and the Alaska State Troopers boarded the vessel around 6 a.m., once they were all tied up, and began the investigation into the incident,” Knowles said.The Coast Guard, Alaska State Troopers and NOAA are jointly investigating the death, and Kumah’s body has been received by the Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy.The Unalaska Fire Department assisted with decontamination onboard the vessel.An American Seafoods spokesperson told SeafoodSource the company is working to provide help to Kumah’s family and his crewmates.“We’re shocked and saddened at this loss, and are in contact with the family to express our deepest condolences and to provide whatever support we can,” the spokesperson said. “We are also providing grief counseling to crew members and are fully cooperating with local authorities. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.”The Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.-based fishing firm, which is currently for sale, is in the process of negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in regard to civil penalties it received for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. The company is also preparing to launch its retrofitted American Empress II, formerly the Phoenix, which it purchased from Phoenix Processor Limited Partnership (PPLP) in June 2023. In July 2023, American Seafoods settled a legal dispute with U.S. Customs and Border Protection for USD 9.5 million (EUR 8.5 million), avoiding over USD 400 million (EUR 359 million) in additional fines levied for its use of a dead-end railway in Canada as means of avoid trading restrictions related to the U.S. Jones Act.The company has revised its strategic direction under the leadership of CEO Einar Gustafsson, who was appointed in February 2022.Photo courtesy of American SeafoodsSubscribeWant seafood news sent to your inbox?You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time.

All ships should proceed with caution, and captains should avoid sailing in thundershower areas.

(WRIC) — The body of a fisherman who went missing after falling off a boat at Dutch Gap Friday morning has been recovered.\nThe Department of Wildlife Resources told 8News that 78-year-old Gary Lee Lane’s body was found at 9:50 a.m. Monday by a search crew near the Meadowville Landing subdivision in Chester. This is approximately 2.5 miles from where he went missing.\nRecovery underway after man in late 70s falls off boat at Dutch Gap\nMultiple units are on the scene of a water rescue in Dutch Gap. (Photo: 8News Reporter Alex Thorson)\nChesterfield authorities responded to a person in the water call around 8:40 a.m. on Friday. According to Paige Pearson with DWR, Lee was out on a boat fishing when he fell in the water.\nPearson said there was another person on the boat with Lee. “He saw him for just a split second when he turned around and looked and by the time he turned the boat around to go back to get him, he didn’t see him,” Pearson said.\nChildren killed, other family members injured in Chesterfield house fire\nDivers and crews searched until sunset Friday and continued their search over the weekend. It was an all-hands-on-deck mission. A coast guard chopper from Elizabeth City joined a cluster of first responders from several nearby agencies in the search.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

The church said in a statement Calvin Robinson's license had been revoked after he made a “gesture that many have interpreted as a pro-Nazi salute.” Robinson made the gesture during a Jan. 25 speech at the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington, D.C.  Robinson said in a statement posted to social media that it was a ”joke\" and that “in case it needs saying: I am not a Nazi.” Musk’s gesture that Robinson was mimicking came in a Jan. 20 speech during celebrations of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.\nSubmit Your News\nWe're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

It reportedly intended to return Oct. 15, according to the United States Coast Guard.\nOn Thursday, one of the fishermen was found in a life raft by good Samaritans approximately 70 miles northwest of Cape Flattery.\n\"I saw what looked like a life raft in the distance and ran inside and put the binoculars on him and then he shot off a flare,\" said Ryan Planes, one of the people who helped save the fisherman.\nRyan Planes and his uncle John, who are from Sooke, British Columbia, were out early with friends on a fishing excursion that turned into a rescue mission.\n\"We pulled him on board. He gave me a big hug and it was emotional,\" John said.\nJohn said the fisherman told him that he was alone on the raft for 13 days, eventually running out of food and water. He told the men that he caught a salmon and ate it to survive.\nCredit: PLANES FAMILY\nA man survived 13 days alone on this life raft off the coast of Washington. A second person who was aboard the original vessel remains missing.\n\"We made him breakfast. He drank three bottles of water. He was pretty hungry, poor guy,\" John said.\nIt was fate that sent John to the exact spot where the life raft was. He wanted to catch more fish and knew that was a good spot to go.\nWith the help of the Canadian Coast Guard, the fisherman was taken to a hospital in Tofino where he is recovering.\nThe second fisherman who was aboard vessel Evening remains missing, according to the Coast Guard.\nThis is a developing story.
